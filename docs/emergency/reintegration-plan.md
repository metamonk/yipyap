# Hotfix Reintegration Plan

## Purpose

This document outlines how to reintegrate the emergency hotfix work back into the normal story-driven development flow.

## Affected Stories Mapping

### Story 1.1: Project Foundation

**Pre-implemented:** Push notification configuration
**Remaining Work:** Full notification service architecture, background notifications

### Story 1.6: Enhanced Profile Management

**Pre-implemented:** Basic online/offline status
**Remaining Work:** Detailed presence, activity status, profile completeness

### Story 2.1: Basic 1-on-1 Chat

**Pre-implemented:** Read receipts, basic push notifications
**Remaining Work:** Typing indicators, message reactions, full notification handling

### Story 2.6: Advanced Chat Management

**Pre-implemented:** Online status in chat
**Remaining Work:** Advanced presence features, Do Not Disturb, custom statuses

### Story 2.7: Group Messaging

**Pre-implemented:** Basic group chat functionality
**Remaining Work:** Admin controls, member management, group settings, media sharing

## Reintegration Process

### Phase 1: Documentation Update (Immediate)

For each affected story, add a section:

```markdown
## Hotfix Implementation Notice

**Date:** 2025-01-21
**Pre-implemented Features:**

- âœ… [Feature name] - Basic implementation complete
  **Technical Debt from Hotfix:**
- [ ] [Specific debt item]
      **Remaining Story Work:**
- [ ] [Original feature not yet implemented]
```

### Phase 2: Story Implementation (When reached in sequence)

When reaching each affected story:

1. Review hotfix implementation
2. Identify gaps vs. original requirements
3. Refactor emergency code to production quality
4. Implement remaining features
5. Clean up technical debt
6. Ensure full test coverage

### Phase 3: Technical Debt Cleanup

Track in separate document:

- Performance optimizations skipped
- Error handling gaps
- Missing edge cases
- Code organization issues
- Test coverage gaps

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All emergency features remain functional
- [ ] Technical debt is documented and assigned
- [ ] Story tracking accurately reflects work done
- [ ] No duplicate implementation
- [ ] Clean git history maintained

## Communication Plan

1. Update team on hotfix completion
2. Note pre-implemented features in sprint planning
3. Adjust story points for affected stories
4. Track velocity impact

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk:** Confusion about what's implemented
  - **Mitigation:** Clear documentation in each story
- **Risk:** Technical debt accumulation
  - **Mitigation:** Mandatory cleanup during story implementation
- **Risk:** Feature regression
  - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing before and after reintegration
