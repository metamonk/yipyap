# Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff

For Story Manager to implement Phase 2:

- Reference this architecture document for all technical decisions
- Start with Story 5.1 (AI Infrastructure Foundation) from the PRD
- Key integration requirements: Maintain Firebase real-time performance, all AI fields optional
- Existing system constraints: Client-heavy architecture, Expo managed workflow
- First story focus: Deploy Vercel Edge Functions with basic categorization
- Critical: Feature flag all AI features for safe rollout

## Developer Handoff

For developers starting implementation:

- Reference this architecture and existing `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`
- Integration requirements: Never break existing messaging, AI processing must be async
- Key technical decisions: Vercel AI SDK for provider abstraction, Edge Functions for speed
- Existing system compatibility: Test with Expo Go first, maintain offline-first design
- Implementation sequence: Infrastructure → Categorization → FAQ → Voice Matching → Dashboard
- Testing requirements: Mock AI services for unit tests, use Firebase emulators
