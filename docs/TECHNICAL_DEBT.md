# Technical Debt Tracking

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-21
**Created From:** Emergency Hotfix Implementation

## Overview

This document tracks technical debt created during the emergency hotfix implementation on 2025-01-21. These features were implemented rapidly to meet urgent business needs, resulting in some architectural compromises and missing features that need to be addressed in future iterations.

## Debt Items by Priority

### ðŸ”´ High Priority (Security & Data Integrity)

#### 1. Read Receipt Reliability

**Location:** `services/messageService.ts`
**Issue:** Read receipts are batched but lack retry logic if batch update fails
**Impact:** Users may not see accurate read status, potential data inconsistency
**Resolution:**

- Implement retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Consider Cloud Functions for server-side read receipt processing
- Add transaction support for atomic updates
  **Target Story:** Enhance Story 2.1 implementation

#### 2. Group Size Validation

**Location:** `app/(tabs)/conversations/new-group.tsx`
**Issue:** Group size limit (10 users) only enforced in Firebase rules, not UI
**Impact:** Poor UX when users try to create oversized groups
**Resolution:**

- Add client-side validation before group creation
- Show clear error message when limit reached
- Consider making limit configurable
  **Target Story:** Future group messaging enhancement

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority (Feature Completeness)

#### 3. Background Push Notifications

**Location:** `services/notificationService.ts`, `hooks/useNotifications.ts`
**Issue:** Only foreground notifications work; no FCM integration
**Impact:** Users don't receive notifications when app is backgrounded/killed
**Resolution:**

- Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- Set up server-side notification sending
- Handle notification tokens and device registration
- Implement notification preferences
  **Target Story:** Complete Story 2.1 notification requirements

#### 4. Presence System Accuracy

**Location:** `services/presenceService.ts`
**Issue:** Using Firestore with 30-second heartbeat instead of Realtime Database
**Impact:** Online/offline status has up to 30-second delay
**Resolution:**

- Migrate to Firebase Realtime Database for presence
- Implement instant presence updates
- Add connection state monitoring
- Handle edge cases (app crash, network loss)
  **Target Story:** Enhance Story 2.6 implementation

#### 5. Group Management Features

**Location:** Group chat screens
**Issue:** Can't edit group name, remove members, or leave groups
**Impact:** Limited group chat functionality
**Resolution:**

- Add group settings screen
- Implement admin/member roles
- Add leave group functionality
- Enable group name/photo editing
- Member management (add/remove)
  **Target Story:** New story for group management

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority (Performance & Polish)

#### 6. User List Pagination

**Location:** `services/userService.ts` - `getAllUsers()`
**Issue:** Fetches entire user base without pagination
**Impact:** Performance degradation with large user counts
**Resolution:**

- Implement cursor-based pagination
- Add user search functionality
- Consider virtualized lists for large datasets
  **Target Story:** Performance optimization sprint

#### 7. Error Handling & Recovery

**Location:** All emergency feature implementations
**Issue:** Minimal error handling and recovery mechanisms
**Resolution:**

- Add comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Implement user-friendly error messages
- Add retry logic for failed operations
- Create error boundary components
  **Target Story:** Quality improvement sprint

#### 8. Test Coverage

**Location:** All emergency features
**Issue:** No unit or integration tests for hotfix features
**Resolution:**

- Write unit tests for services
- Add integration tests for critical flows
- Implement E2E tests for user journeys
- Set up continuous testing pipeline
  **Target Story:** QA Epic

## Resolution Strategy

1. **Immediate (Next Sprint):** Address high-priority security and data integrity issues
2. **Short-term (2-3 Sprints):** Complete medium-priority feature gaps
3. **Long-term (Quarterly):** Optimize performance and add comprehensive testing

## Notes

- All debt items have been documented in their respective story files
- Consider creating dedicated cleanup stories for larger debt items
- Regular debt review in sprint planning sessions recommended
- Track debt burn-down rate alongside feature velocity
