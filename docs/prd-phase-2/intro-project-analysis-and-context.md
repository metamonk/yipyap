- Comprehensive brief provided in ignore/brief.md

### Current Project State

YipYap is a **fully functional real-time mobile chat application** built on React Native/Expo with Firebase backend. The MVP (Phase 1) has been implemented with 4 completed epics:

1. **Foundation & Authentication** - User registration, login, and profile management
2. **Real-Time Direct Messaging** - One-on-one messaging with persistence and optimistic UI
3. **Communication Status & Notifications** - Online/offline indicators, read receipts, push notifications
4. **Group Chat & Conversation Management** - Multi-user conversations and high-volume management features

The application provides creators with a dedicated, high-performance communication hub with enterprise-grade reliability, sub-second message delivery, and offline support.

## Enhancement Scope Definition

### Enhancement Type

✅ **New Feature Addition** - AI Intelligence Layer
✅ **Integration with New Systems** - Cloud AI services (Multiple providers via Vercel AI SDK)
✅ **Performance/Scalability Improvements** - AI-powered automation for handling high message volumes

### Enhancement Description

Adding a comprehensive AI intelligence layer that provides automatic message categorization, voice-matched response drafting, FAQ auto-responders, sentiment analysis, opportunity scoring, and autonomous daily DM workflow management - transforming the chat platform into an intelligent assistant that scales creator engagement without sacrificing authenticity.

### Impact Assessment

✅ **Major Impact (architectural changes required)** - Requires new AI service integrations, Edge Function deployment, data processing pipelines, metadata schema extensions, and cloud function implementations

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Reduce creator message management time by 50%+
- Achieve 85%+ accuracy in automatic message categorization (fan/business/spam/urgent)
- Enable 90%+ business opportunity capture rate
- Maintain authentic creator voice with 80%+ creator satisfaction on AI-generated responses
- Handle 40% of incoming messages autonomously through FAQ detection
- Provide crisis detection with 90%+ accuracy for sensitive situations
- Deploy Edge Functions achieving <500ms latency for categorization

### Background Context

Content creators face overwhelming communication burdens with 100-500+ daily DMs, creating an impossible choice between manual management (sacrificing content creation time) or ignoring messages (damaging relationships and missing opportunities). The Phase 1 MVP established a rock-solid chat foundation optimized for creator workflows. Phase 2 transforms this foundation by adding intelligent automation that categorizes messages, drafts responses in the creator's voice, handles FAQs automatically, and scores business opportunities - solving the creator communication crisis while maintaining authentic engagement.
