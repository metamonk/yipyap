# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall automatically categorize incoming messages into predefined categories (Fan Engagement, Business Opportunity, Spam, Urgent) using AI classification with 85%+ accuracy.

**FR2:** The system shall generate response suggestions that match the creator's communication style by training on their historical message patterns, achieving 80%+ creator approval rating.

**FR3:** The system shall identify frequently asked questions and automatically respond with creator-approved answers without manual intervention.

**FR4:** The system shall analyze message sentiment in real-time to flag negative, upset, or crisis situations requiring immediate creator attention.

**FR5:** The system shall score incoming messages on their likelihood of representing valuable business opportunities (sponsorships, partnerships, collaborations).

**FR6:** The system shall provide an autonomous AI agent that performs daily DM workflow management including categorization, auto-responses, drafting, and summary generation.

**FR7:** The system shall maintain full message history and audit logs of all AI actions for transparency and creator control.

**FR8:** The system shall allow creators to review, edit, or reject any AI-generated responses before sending.

**FR9:** The system shall provide an FAQ library interface where creators can manage and approve standard responses for common questions.

**FR10:** The system shall integrate with cloud-based AI services via unified provider abstraction while preserving message privacy and security.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** AI categorization must process messages within 500ms via Edge Functions to maintain real-time user experience.

**NFR2:** The system must handle AI processing for 1,000+ concurrent creators without performance degradation.

**NFR3:** AI services must maintain 99.5%+ uptime with graceful fallback to manual mode during outages.

**NFR4:** All message data processed by AI must be encrypted in transit and follow enterprise-grade security standards.

**NFR5:** The system must not train global AI models on individual creator data, ensuring complete data privacy.

**NFR6:** AI processing costs must remain predictable and scale linearly with usage ($0.01-0.03 per 1K tokens).

**NFR7:** Voice matching models must be retrained weekly to maintain accuracy as creator communication style evolves.

**NFR8:** The system must provide clear AI transparency indicators showing when automation is being used.

**NFR9:** Edge Functions must achieve <100ms cold start times for optimal performance.

**NFR10:** The system must support A/B testing different AI models for continuous optimization.

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1: Existing API Compatibility** - All current Firebase Firestore APIs and real-time listeners must continue functioning without modification.

**CR2: Database Schema Compatibility** - Message metadata fields for AI must be added without breaking existing message structure or requiring data migration.

**CR3: UI/UX Consistency** - AI features must integrate seamlessly with existing React Native UI components and follow established design patterns.

**CR4: Integration Compatibility** - Push notifications, offline sync, and message persistence must remain fully functional with AI enhancements.
