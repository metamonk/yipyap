notes: |
  Story 2.9 addresses critical technical debt from an emergency hotfix. The implementation
  is comprehensive and well-architected with proper retry mechanisms, idempotency handling,
  and transaction support. A critical React Native compatibility issue with the crypto module
  was discovered and fixed during review. The fix replaces Node.js crypto with a deterministic
  djb2 hash algorithm suitable for React Native environments.

  All 10 acceptance criteria have been fully implemented and tested. The solution includes
  exponential backoff, circuit breaker patterns, persistent queue storage, and proper UI
  feedback. Test coverage is comprehensive with both unit and integration tests.

  Gate decision is CONCERNS rather than PASS due to the critical issue found, even though
  it has been resolved. This ensures the development team is aware of the close call and
  reviews the changes carefully.
