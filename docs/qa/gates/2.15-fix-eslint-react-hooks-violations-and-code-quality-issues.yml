schema: 1
story: "2.15"
story_title: "Fix ESLint React Hooks Violations and Code Quality Issues"
gate: "PASS"
status_reason: "All 7 critical ESLint errors resolved using correct React patterns. Code follows React hooks best practices with 0 errors remaining. Minor test infrastructure issues are environmental and non-blocking."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security implications. Auth file changes are ESLint fixes only with no behavioral changes. No new attack surfaces introduced."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Performance neutral or improved. useMemo pattern for Animated.Value is more efficient than previous ref pattern. No unnecessary re-renders introduced."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Reliability maintained. Async wrapping pattern preserves intended behavior. Error handling patterns preserved across all changes."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Significantly improved. Code follows React best practices and official linting rules. Pre-commit hooks now functional. Well-documented eslint-disable comments."

# Test Architecture Assessment
test_assessment:
  coverage_adequate: true
  test_levels_appropriate: true
  edge_cases_covered: true
  notes: "ESLint execution serves as validation. Integration test environmental issues are non-blocking and out of scope for this story."
