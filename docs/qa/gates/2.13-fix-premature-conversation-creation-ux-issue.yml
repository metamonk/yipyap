nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Security rules include isAtomicCreation() helper function (firestore.rules:173-178) with proper participant and sender validation enforced. Group size limits enforced. CRITICAL GAP: isAtomicCreation() function has never been tested with Firebase Emulator - this is a security-critical function that deserves integration testing."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "PerformanceMonitor integrated for all atomic operations (conversationService.ts:296-433). Transaction overhead acceptable (2 writes). Retry queue with exponential backoff prevents retry storms. Draft mode optimization eliminates unnecessary Firestore reads. Performance validated through unit tests."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Retry queue integration properly implemented for network failures (messageService.ts:521-556). Race condition handling through deterministic IDs for direct messages. Offline queue validated through unit tests (messageService.test.ts:348-395). Error categorization for intelligent retry logic."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality with comprehensive JSDoc documentation, proper TypeScript typing, clean service layer abstraction. Minimal linting warnings (only console.log in non-critical paths). Type-safe navigation params."
