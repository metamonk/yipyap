    status: "✅ RESOLVED"
    resolution: "Comprehensive data validation added to firebase/firestore.rules including required fields validation (8 fields), username format validation (regex, 3-20 chars, lowercase alphanumeric + underscore), displayName length validation (1-50 chars), email validation, presence object validation (status enum, timestamp), settings object validation (boolean fields), and optional fields validation (photoURL, fcmToken). 14 new tests added to verify validation."

    finding: "Storage rules lack file size and content type validation"
    status: "✅ RESOLVED"
    resolution: "File validation added to firebase/storage.rules including 5MB file size limit and content type validation (image/* only). Delete operations separated from create/update for proper validation. 11 new tests added to verify file size limits and content type restrictions."

    severity: low
    finding: "Test helper functions not extracted (code duplication)"
    status: "✅ PARTIALLY RESOLVED"
    resolution: "Helper function createValidUserData() added to firestore.test.ts to reduce duplication. Minor duplication remains in admin context setup, but acceptable for current test suite size."

# NFR (Non-Functional Requirements) validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent security posture with comprehensive access control AND data validation. All security concerns from initial review have been fully resolved."
    findings:
      - "✅ Access control: Excellent (auth.uid validation, path-based access)"
      - "✅ Authentication: Strong (all sensitive operations require auth)"
      - "✅ Deny-by-default: Excellent (catch-all rules prevent undefined path access)"
      - "✅ Data validation: Comprehensive (required fields, types, formats, constraints)"
      - "✅ File validation: Strong (5MB limit, image/* content type only)"
      - "✅ Username protection: Excellent (immutability, hijacking prevention)"

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Rule complexity remains low despite comprehensive validation. Test execution fast (2.148s for 60 tests). No performance concerns."
    findings:
      - "✅ Rule complexity: Low (validation is efficient)"
      - "✅ Test execution: 2.148 seconds for 60 tests"
      - "✅ Emulator performance: Good"

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent test reliability with 100% pass rate across 60 tests. Proper test isolation maintained."
    findings:
      - "✅ Test reliability: 100% pass rate (60/60 tests)"
      - "✅ Test isolation: Proper cleanup between tests"

      - "✅ Test data management: Helper function added (createValidUserData)"

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Outstanding documentation (488+ lines), excellent code clarity, minor test code duplication acceptable. Helper function added to improve maintainability."
    findings:
      - "✅ Code clarity: Excellent (clear validation rules with inline comments)"
      - "✅ Documentation: Outstanding (comprehensive SECURITY_RULES.md with validation examples)"
      - "✅ Configuration: Well-organized (firebase.json, jest.rules.config.js)"
