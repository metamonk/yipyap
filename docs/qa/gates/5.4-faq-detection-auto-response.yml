      details: "While read receipts should work (auto-response is standard message), add explicit test for confidence."

fixes_since_last_review:
  - issue: "INTEGRATION-001"
    status: RESOLVED
    details: "FAQ detection fully integrated into message flow at services/messageService.ts:319-328. Uses fire-and-forget pattern with detectFAQForNewMessage() from faqService.ts."

  - issue: "DATA-001"
    status: RESOLVED
    details: "Edge Function now fetches and returns actual FAQ answer from Firestore using getFAQAnswer() helper at api/detect-faq.ts:111-124. Fixed at lines 407 and 452."

  - issue: "TEST-001"
    status: PARTIAL
    details: "Integration tests created (6 tests across 2 files) but not yet run with Firebase Emulator. Downgraded from HIGH to MEDIUM severity."

strengths:
  - "Critical integration issues resolved - feature is now functional end-to-end"
  - "Excellent unit test coverage with 97 passing tests (100% for completed modules)"
  - "Integration tests proactively created covering IV1 and IV3"
  - "Comprehensive JSDoc documentation exceeds coding standards"
  - "Robust Firestore security rules with thorough validation"
  - "Good error handling with user-friendly messages"
  - "Fire-and-forget pattern prevents FAQ detection from blocking message delivery"
  - "Cloud Functions follow best practices for error handling and logging"
  - "Service layer properly abstracts Firebase access from components"
  - "Performance monitoring instrumentation in place (logging structure ready)"

code_quality_highlights:
  - "Clean separation of concerns across layers (UI, service, API, Cloud Functions)"
  - "Consistent use of TypeScript interfaces and type safety"
  - "Non-blocking error handling for non-critical operations (embeddings, analytics)"
  - "Proper use of Firebase serverTimestamp for message ordering"
  - "Rate limiting implemented in Edge Function"
  - "Dynamic import in messageService prevents circular dependencies"
  - "Graceful degradation when FAQ template not found in Firestore"
