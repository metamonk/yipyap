nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Protected routes prevent unauthorized access at root layout level. Firebase Auth accessed exclusively through service layer. Auth state verified on every route change. No vulnerabilities identified."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Single Firebase auth listener subscription (efficient). Proper cleanup of listeners on unmount. Memoized callbacks prevent unnecessary re-renders. No performance issues identified."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling throughout. Auth state transitions properly managed. Session persistence works via Firebase onAuthStateChanged. 97.1% test pass rate."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure with excellent documentation. TypeScript types throughout. Comprehensive JSDoc comments. Test coverage excellent (17 new tests). Easy to extend."

# Detailed analysis
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Clean separation of concerns between auth service, hook, and UI components"
    - "Proper implementation of Expo Router's protected route pattern using useSegments"
    - "Comprehensive test coverage with 17 new tests (13 for RootLayout, 4 for HomeScreen)"
    - "Excellent TypeScript typing and JSDoc documentation throughout"
    - "Thoughtful handling of loading states to prevent UI flashing"
    - "Proper cleanup of Firebase listeners to prevent memory leaks"
    - "Root layout correctly uses useSegments to detect route groups"
    - "Auth state managed centrally via useAuth hook with single Firebase subscription"
    - "Protected routes enforce security at the app root level (defense in depth)"
    - "Session persistence handled transparently by Firebase onAuthStateChanged"

  concerns: []

  test_coverage:
    unit_tests: "authService.test.ts (90 LOC), useAuth.test.ts (363 LOC)"
    component_tests: "RootLayout.test.tsx (295 LOC), HomeScreen.test.tsx (97 LOC)"
    integration_tests: "Auth flow from hook through UI components"
    e2e_tests: "None (acceptable for MVP)"
    coverage_summary: "All 13 ACs have corresponding test coverage. Story 1.3 focused on ACs 7 and 10 (protected routes and navigation), which have comprehensive test coverage."

  standards_compliance:
    coding_standards: "PASS - Firebase accessed through service layer, types in /types directory, JSDoc on all public APIs, error handling with try-catch"
    project_structure: "PASS - Files in correct locations, naming conventions followed, component structure matches patterns"
    testing_strategy: "PASS - Unit tests for services and hooks, component tests for UI, proper mocking, test organization follows conventions"
