# Quality Gate Decision for Story 3.3: Read Receipts System
# Powered by BMAD™ Core - Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "3.3"
story_title: "Read Receipts System"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Production code remains excellent with robust implementation. QA fixes attempted but introduced new test infrastructure problems: integration tests created but all failing (0/13), ProfileEdit tests partially working (2/7). However, 2 of 4 original issues properly resolved (TEST-001, TEST-004). Recommend fixing test infrastructure before release."

# Top issues identified during review
top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-002-UPDATED"
    severity: high
    finding: "Integration test created but all 13 tests failing - Firebase mocking setup broken (getFirestore is not a function, RetryQueue.destroy() doesn't exist)"
    impact: "High - Integration tests are critical for release confidence. File exists but provides no value in current state."
    suggested_action: "Fix Firebase emulator setup: properly mock Firebase initialization, implement RetryQueue.destroy() method, or use real Firebase Emulator Suite. Consider simplifying test setup or using test utilities from existing passing tests."
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: ["tests/integration/read-receipts.test.ts:67 (Firebase init)", "tests/integration/read-receipts.test.ts:147 (RetryQueue.destroy)"]

  - id: "TEST-003-UPDATED"
    severity: medium
    finding: "ProfileEdit read receipts tests partially working - only 2 of 7 tests passing, 5 failing due to Alert.alert mock issue"
    impact: "Medium - Basic rendering tests pass, but interaction tests fail. Reduces regression confidence for settings UI."
    suggested_action: "Mock React Native Alert API properly in test setup, OR refactor error handling to use a testable error service instead of Alert.alert directly"
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: ["tests/unit/components/ProfileEdit.test.tsx:327-488", "app/(tabs)/profile/edit.tsx:206 (Alert.alert usage)"]

  - id: "LINT-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Linting error in integration test: 'originalUpdateDoc' is assigned but never used (line 296)"
    impact: "Low - Blocks clean CI/CD but easy to fix"
    suggested_action: "Remove unused variable or use it in test restoration logic"
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: ["tests/integration/read-receipts.test.ts:296"]

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "RESOLVED - FirestoreError mock limitation properly documented in test file and testing-strategy.md"
    impact: "None - Documentation explains limitation and confirms production code is correct"
    suggested_action: "No action required - issue resolved"
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: ["tests/unit/services/messageService.readReceipt.test.ts:6-21", "docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md:178-211"]
    status: resolved

  - id: "TEST-004"
    severity: low
    finding: "RESOLVED - MessageStatus blue checkmark tests added and passing (3 new tests, all passing)"
    impact: "None - Issue fully resolved"
    suggested_action: "No action required - issue resolved"
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: ["tests/unit/components/chat/MessageStatus.test.tsx:57-93"]

    notes: "Production code has excellent error handling and retry queue integration. However, unable to verify reliability through integration tests due to test infrastructure failures."

  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Production code maintains excellent JSDoc documentation and organization. Test infrastructure issues complicate future maintenance and reduce CI/CD confidence."

# Detailed recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate:  # Should address before considering Done
    - action: "Fix integration test Firebase mocking/emulator setup"
      priority: high
      effort: medium
      refs: ["tests/integration/read-receipts.test.ts"]
      rationale: "Integration tests critical for release confidence. Current 0/13 pass rate provides no value."

    - action: "Fix ProfileEdit Alert.alert mock issue for settings tests"
      priority: medium
      effort: small
      refs: ["tests/unit/components/ProfileEdit.test.tsx:327-488"]
      rationale: "5 of 7 read receipts settings tests failing. Need working tests for regression confidence."

    - action: "Remove unused variable in integration test to fix linting"
      priority: low
      effort: trivial
      refs: ["tests/integration/read-receipts.test.ts:296"]
      rationale: "Quick fix to clean CI/CD pipeline"

  future:  # Can be addressed in future sprint
    - action: "Consider extracting viewport detection logic to reusable hook"
      priority: low
      effort: medium
      refs: ["app/(tabs)/conversations/[id].tsx:252-314"]
      rationale: "Improves code reusability and testability"

    - action: "Add performance test for rapid scrolling with 100+ messages"
      priority: low
      effort: medium
      refs: ["docs/stories/3.3.story.md:136-143 (Task 13)"]
      rationale: "Validates viewport detection performs well under load"

# QA Review History
history:
  - at: "2025-10-22T00:00:00Z"
    gate: CONCERNS
    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
    note: "Initial review - Core functionality excellent, test coverage gaps (missing integration test, 2 unit tests failing due to mock issues). Quality score: 80/100"

  - at: "2025-10-22T12:00:00Z"
    gate: CONCERNS
    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
    note: "QA fixes attempted: TEST-001 and TEST-004 fully resolved. However, TEST-002 and TEST-003 introduced new test infrastructure problems. Overall test pass rate decreased from 10/12 to 22/32. Production code remains excellent. Quality score decreased to 75/100 due to new high-severity integration test issues."

# Implementation quality highlights
implementation_highlights:
  strengths:
    - "Production code quality remains excellent - markMessageAsRead function (589-679) has robust sequencing, idempotency, privacy controls"
    - "All 6 implementation steps properly coded with comprehensive error handling"
    - "Privacy-first design with user preference checking maintained"
    - "Atomic Firestore updates using arrayUnion prevent race conditions"
    - "Retry queue integration for offline resilience working correctly"
    - "TEST-001 properly resolved with excellent documentation of FirestoreError mock limitation"
    - "TEST-004 fully resolved - MessageStatus tests all passing (14/14)"

  concerns:
    - "Integration tests created but completely non-functional (0/13 passing) - Firebase mocking broken"
    - "ProfileEdit tests mostly failing (2/7 passing) - Alert.alert mock issue"
    - "Overall test coverage situation worsened: went from 10/12 unit tests to 22/32 total tests (69% pass rate)"
    - "QA fixes introduced new test infrastructure problems that didn't exist before"
    - "Linting error in integration test (unused variable)"

# Test results summary

  unit_tests:
    messageService_readReceipt: "10/12 passing (83%) - 2 failing due to documented FirestoreError mock limitation"
    MessageStatus: "14/14 passing (100%) - TEST-004 fully resolved ✅"
    ProfileEdit_readReceipts: "2/7 passing (29%) - 5 failing due to Alert.alert mock issue"

  integration_tests:
    read_receipts: "0/13 passing (0%) - All failing due to Firebase mocking setup issues ❌"

  overall: "22/32 passing (69% pass rate) - Test situation worsened after QA fixes"

  comparison_to_previous_review:
    before: "10/12 unit tests (83%), 0 integration tests"
