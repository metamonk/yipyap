status_reason: "All critical issues from previous review have been successfully resolved. Race condition fixed with proper effect cleanup, 41 real tests implemented replacing placeholders, and photo upload feature properly disabled with user-friendly messaging. Remaining items are documented partial implementations that do not impact quality or reliability."

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent permission model with isGroupAdmin checks throughout. Service-layer validation prevents bypassing. Admin removal protection working correctly. No changes needed."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Outstanding cursor-based pagination design (O(1) performance). Proper use of Firestore orderBy/startAfter/limit. 300ms search debouncing implemented. Client-side search acceptable for MVP scale."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Race condition resolved via unified effect with cancellation tokens. Error handling comprehensive throughout. Admin transfer logic solid. No blocking reliability concerns."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exemplary TSDoc documentation on all public APIs. Clean separation of concerns. Backwards compatible with legacy groups via creatorId fallback. Code is highly maintainable."

strengths:
  - "Outstanding permission architecture with adminIds array and backwards compatibility"
  - "Excellent pagination design using Firestore cursors for constant O(1) performance"
  - "Comprehensive TSDoc documentation following project standards"
  - "Clean service layer abstraction preventing direct Firebase access"
  - "Thoughtful admin transfer logic when last admin leaves"
  - "Type safety throughout with proper TypeScript usage"
  - "Proper race condition prevention with effect cancellation tokens"
  - "Professional handling of incomplete features with clear user messaging"
  - "41 real tests with proper mocking and assertions across service and integration layers"

resolved_concerns:
  - "✓ FIXED: Test coverage - 41 real tests implemented (74% real vs 26% deferred UI tests)"
  - "✓ FIXED: Photo upload feature properly disabled with 'Coming Soon' alerts instead of broken UX"
  - "✓ FIXED: Hook race condition resolved with single unified effect + cancellation pattern"

remaining_notes:
  - "14 UI test placeholders are legitimately deferred (Lines 234-341 in group-management.test.tsx)"
  - "These UI tests require components marked as partial implementations in Dev Notes"
  - "Service layer and integration tests are comprehensive and provide confidence in business logic"
  - "Partial implementations (navigation, member UI, toasts) are clearly documented and don't block release"
