    status: PASS
    notes: "Firestore rules correctly configured. Participant validation implemented. Per-user privacy maintained."
    findings:
      - "archivedBy field included in allowed update fields (firestore.rules:161-162)"
      - "Participant validation in archiveConversation() prevents unauthorized access"
      - "Auto-unarchive runs client-side (minor concern) but Firebase rules provide protection"

  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Query efficiency issue due to Firestore limitations. Acceptable for MVP but should be monitored."
    findings:
      - "subscribeToArchivedConversations() fetches all conversations then filters (inefficient)"
      - "Performance degrades with >100 conversations"
      - "Optimistic UI provides good user experience"
      - "Offline behavior works correctly"
      - "Composite index required (self-resolving via Firebase prompt)"

  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "No automated tests to verify reliability. Code quality is excellent but lacks validation."
    findings:
      - "Real-time listeners correctly implemented"
      - "Error handling comprehensive with try-catch blocks"
      - "Offline queueing supported by Firestore"
      - "BUT: Zero test coverage means no regression protection"

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality, documentation, and architecture. Easy to maintain."
    findings:
      - "JSDoc documentation: 100% coverage on public APIs"
      - "Service layer pattern correctly implemented"
      - "TypeScript types well-defined with no 'any' types"
      - "Clean component architecture with separation of concerns"
      - "Follows project coding standards"
