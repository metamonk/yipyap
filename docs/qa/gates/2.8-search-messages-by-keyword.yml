  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Cross-conversation search loads 50 messages from each conversation, potentially 1000+ messages for users with 20+ conversations"
    suggested_action: "Monitor Firestore read counts in production; consider pagination or limiting to recent N conversations in future iteration"

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Component unit tests (SearchBar, SearchResultItem) blocked by react-test-renderer version mismatch"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Client-side search maintains existing security posture. No new endpoints exposed. Firestore rules continue to enforce access control."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Excellent local optimizations (debouncing, memoization, <50ms for 1000 messages). Concern: cross-conversation search may load 1000+ messages for users with many conversations. Requires production monitoring."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, graceful degradation with empty states, extensive edge case coverage in tests."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent JSDoc documentation, strong TypeScript typing, clear separation of concerns, well-organized file structure."
