# Risk Summary
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 1  # Accuracy validation missing
    high: 2      # Performance validation, notification system
    medium: 2    # UI integration, integration testing
    low: 1       # Code optimization
  highest_risk:
    area: "Testing & Validation"
    score: 10
    rationale: "90% accuracy requirement (AC 5) is completely unvalidated. This is a hard acceptance criteria with specific numerical target that must be met and proven before story can be considered 'Done'."
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Create accuracy test dataset with 100+ labeled messages (positive, negative, neutral, mixed)"
      - "Run accuracy validation and achieve 90%+ precision/recall for negative sentiment detection"
      - "Implement performance tests to validate <500ms latency requirement"
      - "Complete crisis notification system (Firebase Cloud Function + client integration)"
      - "Integrate sentiment UI components into conversation list and message views"
    monitor:
      - "Track sentiment analysis latency in production to ensure <500ms maintained under load"
      - "Monitor false positive/negative rates for crisis detection"

# NFR Validation Results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API keys properly secured in Vercel environment variables. Authentication via Firebase Auth tokens. Rate limiting implemented via Upstash Redis. No security issues identified."

  performance:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "CRITICAL: No performance testing conducted. Cannot validate <500ms requirement (AC IV3). Design choices are sound (single API call, GPT-4o-mini, edge functions) but must be validated with load testing."

  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Error handling and retry logic implemented well. However, no testing of failure scenarios, timeout handling, or circuit breaker behavior (Task 13). Partial sentiment failures not tested."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality: comprehensive JSDoc documentation, proper TypeScript types, clean service layer separation. Unit tests exist for parsing logic. Code is well-structured and maintainable."

    - "UI components isolated from actual UI (not integrated)"
    - "Missing critical notification system implementation"

# Final Assessment
assessment: |
  **Gate Decision: FAIL**

  Story 5.3 has a solid technical foundation with excellent code quality for the completed
  portions (Tasks 1-5). The implementation demonstrates good architectural decisions:
  - Combined API call for categorization + sentiment (efficient)
  - GPT-4o-mini selection (cost-effective)
  - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
  - Accessible UI components with WCAG AA compliance
  - Excellent documentation and type safety

  However, the story is only 36% complete (5 of 14 tasks). Critical gaps prevent approval:

  **Blocking Issues:**
  1. **No accuracy validation** - AC 5 requires 90%+ negative sentiment detection accuracy.
     Zero testing of this hard requirement. Cannot approve without validation.

  2. **No performance validation** - AC IV3 requires <500ms for combined operation.
     No baseline, no load testing, no validation. Critical SLA unproven.

  3. **Missing crisis notifications** - AC 4 requires push notifications for crisis detection.
     Notification system completely absent. Core feature not implemented.

  4. **UI not integrated** - AC 3 requires visual indicators. Components created but not
     visible to users. Sentiment data processed but not displayed.

  5. **No integration testing** - Unit tests exist for parsing logic, but end-to-end API
     behavior is untested.

  **Estimated Remaining Work:** 6-8 hours
  - UI Integration: 2 hours
  - Notification System: 2-3 hours
  - Testing (accuracy + performance + integration): 2-3 hours

  **Recommendation:** Dev should complete Tasks 6-14 with focus on critical validation
  (Tasks 10-11) and missing features (Tasks 6-8). The foundation is excellent; remaining
  work is primarily integration, testing, and validation - not rework.

  Story will be re-reviewed once all critical tasks are complete and all ACs are validated.
