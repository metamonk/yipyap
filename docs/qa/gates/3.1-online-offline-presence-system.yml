# Story-specific notes
notes: |
  Story 3.1 is a verification story confirming that the Online/Offline Presence System
  functionality was comprehensively implemented in Story 2.12 (Technical Debt - RTDB
  Presence Migration).

  Key strengths:
  - Industry best practices (RTDB for presence)
  - Read-Aggregate-Write pattern prevents race conditions
  - Multi-device support with proper aggregation
  - Comprehensive test coverage (55 tests, 100% pass rate)
  - Excellent documentation (JSDoc on all public APIs)
  - Production-ready quality

  The only identified issue is a minor linting warning that does not affect functionality
  and can be addressed in a future refactoring cycle.
