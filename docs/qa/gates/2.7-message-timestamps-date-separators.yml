# Gate decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  Story 2.7 receives a PASS gate decision based on the following comprehensive assessment:

  STRENGTHS:
  1. Complete Implementation: All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated
  2. Test Coverage: Comprehensive testing at unit (38 tests), integration (4 tests), and E2E (8 tests) levels
  3. Code Quality: Excellent documentation (JSDoc), type safety (discriminated unions), error handling
  4. Architecture: Clean separation of concerns, proper use of React patterns (memoization, callbacks)
  5. Standards Compliance: Adheres to project coding standards and testing strategy

  IMPROVEMENTS MADE:
  1. Eliminated code duplication (type definitions consolidated, constants extracted)
  2. Enhanced debuggability (added console.warn for edge cases)
  3. Improved maintainability through refactoring

  MINOR NOTES:
  1. Two pre-existing test issues identified (unrelated to this story, do not block)
  2. Future optimization opportunities documented for reference

  QUALITY SCORE: 90/100
  - Deduction of 10 points for minor refactoring needed (now completed)
  - No deductions for functionality or testing
  - Pre-existing issues not counted against this story

  RECOMMENDATION: Ready for production deployment
