nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Database rules properly restrict write access ($uid === auth.uid). All authenticated users can read presence (appropriate for messaging app). Input validation via RTDB rules. Minor: No rate limiting (acceptable - connection-based, not request-based).'

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Instant updates achieved (<2 seconds per AC2). Multi-device aggregation bug fixed = no wasted writes. Efficient use of update() instead of set() preserves bandwidth. Debouncing implemented (300ms for typing). Exponential backoff prevents reconnection storms. Operation queue limited to 50 items prevents memory bloat.'

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks. Operation queuing ensures no data loss during offline periods. onDisconnect handlers guarantee cleanup on unexpected disconnects. Multi-device aggregation bug fixed = reliable presence status. All edge cases tested and passing.'

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Outstanding JSDoc documentation throughout. Strong TypeScript typing with well-defined interfaces. Clean service layer architecture. Proper separation of concerns (services, hooks, components, utils). Well-organized test suite. Clear Dev Notes section with architectural patterns documented.'

  FOURTH RE-REVIEW (FINAL) - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED - PRODUCTION READY ‚úÖ

  üéâ CONGRATULATIONS - Story Complete!

  All critical issues from previous reviews have been successfully resolved:

  ‚úÖ RESOLVED ISSUES:

  1. Multi-Device Aggregation Bug (AC8) - FIXED in v1.1
     - Original Issue: updateAggregatedPresence() was overwriting device data
     - Fix Verified: Lines 154-185 correctly implement Read-Aggregate-Write pattern
     - Uses get() to read all devices, aggregates properly, uses update() to preserve
     - Impact: Multi-device tracking now works reliably

  2. AC4 UI Integration - COMPLETE in v1.2
     - Original Issue: PresenceIndicator component existed but not integrated in UI
     - Fix Verified:
       * Conversation List: ConversationListItem.tsx:103-107 (with position styling)
       * Chat View Header: [id].tsx:308 (with showLastSeen support)
     - Impact: Users can now see real-time online/offline status everywhere

  3. useConnectionState Reactivity Bug - FIXED in v1.2
     - Original Issue: queuedCount used ref value instead of state
     - Fix Verified: Line 55 uses useState(0), properly updated in all operations
     - Impact: Queue count properly triggers re-renders, all 12 tests now pass

  ‚úÖ TEST RESULTS:
  - presenceService.test.ts: 23/23 passing ‚úÖ
  - presence-system.test.ts: 20/20 passing ‚úÖ
  - useConnectionState.test.ts: 12/12 passing ‚úÖ
  - Total: 55/55 passing (100% pass rate) ‚úÖ

  ‚úÖ LINTING:
  - Zero errors ‚úÖ
  - Only console.log warnings in scripts (acceptable)

  ‚úÖ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (10/10 COMPLETE):
  AC1: Migrate to RTDB ‚úÖ
  AC2: Updates within 2 seconds ‚úÖ
  AC3: Last seen timestamp ‚úÖ
  AC4: Indicators in list and chat ‚úÖ (FIXED in v1.2)
  AC5: Handle online/offline/away ‚úÖ
  AC6: Automatic offline on background ‚úÖ
  AC7: onDisconnect cleanup ‚úÖ
  AC8: Multi-device support ‚úÖ (FIXED in v1.1)
  AC9: Typing indicators with presence ‚úÖ
  AC10: Handle network reconnection ‚úÖ (FIXED in v1.2)

  üöÄ DEPLOYMENT READY:
  - All functionality complete and tested
  - All bugs fixed and verified
  - Linting clean
