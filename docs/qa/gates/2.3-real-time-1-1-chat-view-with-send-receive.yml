    finding: "ChatScreen passes empty participantIds array to useMessages before conversation loads"
    status: "✅ RESOLVED"
    resolution: "Guard clause added to handleSendMessage (lines 351-355 in useMessages.ts). Prevents sending messages with empty participantIds and throws user-friendly error: 'Conversation not ready. Please try again.'"

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Integration tests bypass service layer, using direct Firestore calls instead of messageService/conversationService"
    status: "ACKNOWLEDGED (non-blocking)"
    note: "Code comment at line 216 in chat-flow.test.ts acknowledges this: 'This test would need to use the actual service methods to test that integration'. Does not block production deployment."

    note: "Auto-scroll tests exist (lines 243-316 in useMessages.test.ts) but specific edge case for 'user manually scrolled up' is not covered"
