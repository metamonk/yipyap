# Quality Gate Decision for Story 5.1
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)
schema: 1
story: "5.1"
story_title: "AI Infrastructure Foundation"
gate: FAIL
status_reason: "Critical implementation deviations from story requirements. Missing Anthropic provider support violates AC1 and AC5. Only OpenAI provider integrated when story explicitly requires both OpenAI and Anthropic for proper model selection and fallback strategy."

architecture_notes: |
  Critical Concern: The implementation has shifted from a multi-provider abstraction (OpenAI + Anthropic)
  to an OpenAI-only approach. This fundamentally changes the Phase 2 AI architecture as described in:

  - Story 5.1 requirements (both providers explicitly specified)
  - Tech stack documentation (Claude Haiku for speed/cost operations)
  - Cost optimization strategy (depends on Anthropic's lower pricing)

  If this was a deliberate architectural decision, it requires:
  1. Story amendment to reflect OpenAI-only approach
  2. Tech stack documentation updates
  3. Cost estimate recalculation for Phase 2
  4. Review of downstream stories (5.2-5.5) dependencies

  Recommendation: Product Owner should clarify whether multi-provider support is still required.
  If OpenAI-only is acceptable, story should be formally amended and gate re-evaluated.
