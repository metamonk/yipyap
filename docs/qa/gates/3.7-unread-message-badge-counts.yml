story: "3.7"
story_title: "Unread Message Badge Counts"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent implementation with comprehensive unit tests (51 passing), but integration tests require Firebase Emulator configuration to run successfully."

# Gate Decision: CONCERNS
# - All 10 acceptance criteria fully implemented ✅
# - Code quality excellent (atomic operations, proper error handling, JSDoc documentation)
# - 51 unit tests passing with comprehensive coverage
# - Integration tests well-written but fail without emulator setup (medium severity)
# - E2E tests scaffolded, awaiting device testing (low priority)

# Gate Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  Gate status set to CONCERNS due to integration test infrastructure issue.

  The implementation quality is excellent:
  - All 10 acceptance criteria fully met
  - Code follows all architectural patterns and coding standards
  - 51 unit tests passing with comprehensive coverage
  - Proper atomic operations, error handling, and resource management

  However, integration tests cannot run without Firebase Emulator setup:
  - Tests are well-written and comprehensive
  - Simply require emulator initialization in test environment
  - Straightforward fix (15-30 minutes)
  - Blocks full CI/CD test execution

  This is a MEDIUM severity issue that should be addressed before "Done" status.
  The fix is simple and well-understood, making this a CONCERNS gate rather than FAIL.
