nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Firestore rules properly restrict deletedBy updates to participants only. Soft delete pattern prevents unauthorized data deletion. Client-side validation complements server-side rules."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Single updateDoc call is efficient. No unnecessary data reads or writes. Offline persistence handles queueing automatically. Real-time updates are near-instantaneous."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages. Graceful degradation when offline. Idempotent operations can safely retry. No cascading failures."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent JSDoc documentation on all public APIs. Clear separation of concerns. Follows established patterns. Test coverage enables confident refactoring. Full TypeScript type safety."

    - "Validation of participant status before deletion"

architectural_alignment:
  - "Consistent with existing archive/mute patterns from Stories 4.1 and 4.5"

  - "Notification filtering correctly excludes deleted conversations"
  - "Real-time updates handled automatically by existing listeners"

review_notes: |
  This is an exemplary implementation that demonstrates best practices:

  1. **Requirements Coverage**: All 10 acceptance criteria fully implemented with test coverage
  2. **Code Quality**: Clean, well-documented code with proper separation of concerns
  3. **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage at unit and integration levels (18/18 tests passing)
  4. **Consistency**: Follows established patterns from previous stories
  5. **Security**: Proper Firestore rules and client-side validation
  6. **UX**: Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
  7. **Performance**: Efficient soft delete with real-time updates

  The developer demonstrated strong understanding of the architecture and delivered
  production-ready code on first submission. No refactoring or corrections needed.

  Minor linting warnings observed are pre-existing and unrelated to this story's changes.
  These can be addressed in a separate cleanup task without blocking this story.
