nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Client-side filtering respects user permissions. Query uses array-contains on participantIds respecting Firestore Security Rules. No security bypass detected.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Query optimization reduces latency. Integration tests confirm conversation list load under 1s (meets NFR7 target). Offline persistence enables instant cache hits.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks. User-friendly error messages. Cursor-based pagination prevents data inconsistencies.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean implementation with proper abstractions (GetConversationsResult interface). Excellent 693-line documentation with code examples and troubleshooting. Complete JSDoc documentation after QA refactoring.'
  cost_efficiency:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'NFR7 exceeded with 97% potential cost reduction ($150/month to $3.87/month for 1000 users). Conversation list limited to 30 docs, messages to 50 docs. Offline persistence reduces redundant reads.'
