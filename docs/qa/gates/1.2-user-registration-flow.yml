  - "Exemplary JSDoc documentation exceeds coding standards"
  - "Service layer architecture prevents direct Firebase access"
  - "Superior UX: button-disabling pattern prevents invalid submissions"
  - "Comprehensive TypeScript types with detailed property documentation"
  - "User-friendly error messages mapped from Firebase codes"
  - "Performance optimizations: useCallback and memo() used appropriately"

  - file: "tests/unit/components/Register.test.tsx"
    change: "Updated 2 tests to verify disabled-button UX behavior"
