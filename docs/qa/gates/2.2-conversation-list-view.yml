# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Service layer separation maintained. No direct Firebase access from components. Security rules enforce participant access. Current user filtering in search prevents self-messaging."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "FlatList optimizations implemented (removeClippedSubviews, memo, keyExtractor). Real-time updates efficient. Avatar caching in place. Message preview truncation client-side."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling in all async operations. Loading states properly managed. Retry via pull-to-refresh. Firestore listener cleanup prevents memory leaks."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "100% JSDoc documentation coverage. TypeScript strict mode compliance. Clean component architecture. Consistent coding patterns. Clear file organization."
