# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "User-scoped Firestore collections, service layer auth checks, rate limiting prevents abuse, budget controls prevent runaway costs. Minor recommendation: add explicit Security Rules tests for new collections."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Monitoring overhead <5ms per operation (requirement: <10ms). Non-blocking async writes, circuit breaker pattern, Firestore indexes deployed."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Circuit breaker prevents monitoring failures from breaking AI operations. Graceful degradation on errors. Atomic Firestore increments prevent race conditions. Scheduled Cloud Functions have retry logic."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive JSDoc documentation on all services. Clear service separation. Consistent code patterns. Well-organized test structure."

    - id: "FUTURE-001"
      area: "Cache Cleanup"
      description: "Cache cleanup relies on TTL checks rather than scheduled job"
      impact: "Minimal - TTL-based expiration is working correctly"
      mitigation: "Consider adding scheduled cleanup job in future sprint"
    - id: "FUTURE-002"
      area: "Security Rules Testing"
      description: "New Firestore collections lack explicit Security Rules tests"
      impact: "Low - collections follow user-scoped pattern"
      mitigation: "Add Security Rules tests in next sprint"
  recommendations:
    must_fix: []
    monitor:
      - "Monitor real-world cache hit rates after deployment and adjust TTLs if needed"
      - "Review budget alert notifications for user feedback"
      - "Verify Firestore Security Rules for new collections in production"
