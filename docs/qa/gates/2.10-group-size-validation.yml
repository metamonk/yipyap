technical_debt_notes: |
  This story successfully addresses the technical debt created by emergency hotfix on 2025-01-21.
  The hotfix only enforced group size limits in Firebase rules without client-side UX feedback.
  This implementation adds comprehensive client-side validation with real-time feedback,
  visual indicators, error messages, and accessibility support while maintaining the
  server-side enforcement as the authoritative source of truth.
