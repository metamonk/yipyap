# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

yipyap delivers a **fast, reliable, and intuitive mobile-first chat experience** that feels instant and responsive. The interface prioritizes performance perception through optimistic UI updates, minimal loading states, and smooth transitions. Users should feel confidence in message delivery through clear status indicators (sending → delivered → read) and real-time presence information. The overall aesthetic is clean, modern, and professional—balancing simplicity for ease of use with enough visual hierarchy to manage high message volumes efficiently.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Optimistic-first interactions:** Every user action (sending messages, archiving conversations) appears to succeed instantly with visual feedback, even before server confirmation
- **Real-time responsiveness:** Live updates for incoming messages, typing indicators, and online/offline status without requiring manual refresh
- **Gesture-based efficiency:** Swipe actions for common tasks (archive, delete, mute) to support quick conversation management
- **Progressive disclosure:** Advanced features (batch actions, search) accessible but not cluttering primary interface
- **Offline-aware UI:** Clear visual indicators when offline, with confidence that queued actions will sync when reconnected

## Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the critical screens necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals:

- **Conversation List (Home Screen):** Primary view showing all active conversations with unread badges, message previews, timestamps, and online status indicators
- **Chat View (1:1):** Full-screen conversation interface for two-person messaging with message history, input field, and real-time status
- **Group Chat View:** Similar to 1:1 chat but with participant list, group management options, and multi-user presence indicators
- **Profile Screen:** User account management (display name, username, profile photo, notification settings)
- **Conversation Settings:** Per-conversation options (mute, archive, delete, participant management for groups)
- **Search Interface:** Global search across all conversations with keyword filtering and results preview

## Accessibility

**WCAG AA compliance** - Minimum standard for text contrast ratios, touch target sizes (44x44pt minimum), and screen reader support. Focus on ensuring core messaging functionality is fully accessible to users with visual or motor impairments.

**Assumptions:** Standard accessibility features sufficient for MVP; no specialized accessibility requirements identified at this stage.

## Branding

**Modern, performance-focused aesthetic** - Clean interface with emphasis on speed and reliability. Visual design should communicate technical excellence and trustworthiness.

**Assumptions:**

- No specific brand guidelines or color palette provided yet
- Default to contemporary mobile chat app patterns (similar to Signal, Telegram aesthetic)
- Branding details can be finalized during design phase

**Questions:** Do you have any specific brand direction, color schemes, or visual references in mind?

## Target Device and Platforms

**Cross-platform mobile (iOS and Android)** - React Native/Expo ensures consistent experience across both platforms. Design prioritizes mobile form factors (phones primarily, tablet support secondary). Web version explicitly out of scope for MVP.
