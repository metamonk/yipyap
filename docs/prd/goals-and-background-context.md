# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

**Desired outcomes for the yipyap MVP:**

- Build a scalable, high-performance real-time messaging platform with sub-500ms message delivery (P95) and 99.5%+ uptime
- Establish technical excellence through optimistic UI, offline-first design, and reliable message persistence
- Successfully support 1,000+ concurrent users with consistent performance
- Create a data architecture ready for future AI integration
- Achieve 100+ active users within 6 months with 60%+ 30-day retention

## Background Context

Real-time chat applications often compromise on performance, reliability, or scalability. yipyap takes a foundation-first approach: build an enterprise-grade, mobile-first messaging platform using React Native/Expo and Firebase that delivers instant message delivery, optimistic UI updates, and rock-solid persistence before adding advanced features.

The MVP focuses exclusively on proving technical excellence—scalable architecture, sub-second latency, offline-first reliability—to create a superior real-time chat experience. This establishes the foundation for Phase 2, which will layer AI intelligence (auto-categorization, response drafting, sentiment analysis) on top of the proven infrastructure. By validating performance and scalability first, yipyap ensures advanced features won't be bottlenecked by foundation issues.
