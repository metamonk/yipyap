## Phase 2: AI Intelligence Layer Requirements

### Phase 2 Functional Requirements

- **FR2.1:** The system shall automatically categorize incoming messages into predefined categories (Fan Engagement, Business Opportunity, Spam, Urgent) using AI classification with 85%+ accuracy
- **FR2.2:** The system shall generate response suggestions that match the creator's communication style by training on their historical message patterns, achieving 80%+ creator approval rating
- **FR2.3:** The system shall identify frequently asked questions and automatically respond with creator-approved answers without manual intervention
- **FR2.4:** The system shall analyze message sentiment in real-time to flag negative, upset, or crisis situations requiring immediate creator attention
- **FR2.5:** The system shall score incoming messages on their likelihood of representing valuable business opportunities (sponsorships, partnerships, collaborations)
- **FR2.6:** The system shall provide an autonomous AI agent that performs daily DM workflow management including categorization, auto-responses, drafting, and summary generation
- **FR2.7:** The system shall maintain full message history and audit logs of all AI actions for transparency and creator control
- **FR2.8:** The system shall allow creators to review, edit, or reject any AI-generated responses before sending
- **FR2.9:** The system shall provide an FAQ library interface where creators can manage and approve standard responses for common questions
- **FR2.10:** The system shall integrate with cloud-based AI services via unified provider abstraction while preserving message privacy and security

### Phase 2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR2.1:** AI categorization must process messages within 500ms via Edge Functions to maintain real-time user experience
- **NFR2.2:** The system must handle AI processing for 1,000+ concurrent creators without performance degradation
- **NFR2.3:** AI services must maintain 99.5%+ uptime with graceful fallback to manual mode during outages
- **NFR2.4:** All message data processed by AI must be encrypted in transit and follow enterprise-grade security standards
- **NFR2.5:** The system must not train global AI models on individual creator data, ensuring complete data privacy
- **NFR2.6:** AI processing costs must remain predictable and scale linearly with usage ($0.01-0.03 per 1K tokens)
- **NFR2.7:** Voice matching models must be retrained weekly to maintain accuracy as creator communication style evolves
- **NFR2.8:** The system must provide clear AI transparency indicators showing when automation is being used
- **NFR2.9:** Edge Functions must achieve <100ms cold start times for optimal performance
- **NFR2.10:** The system must support A/B testing different AI models for continuous optimization

### Phase 2 Compatibility Requirements
