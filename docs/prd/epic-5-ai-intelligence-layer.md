## Story 5.10: Chat UI Performance - Inverted FlatList Migration

**As a** user,
**I want** smooth, jank-free message scrolling in chat conversations,
**so that** the chat interface feels professional and responsive without visual stuttering.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Chat messages render using React Native's industry-standard inverted FlatList pattern (`inverted={true}`)
2. New messages automatically appear at the bottom without manual scroll management
3. No multiple rapid scroll executions (eliminated 4+ scroll jank)
4. Older message pagination loads correctly when scrolling up without position jumping
5. Read receipts continue to work correctly with viewability callbacks (Story 3.3 compatibility)
6. Date separators render in correct chronological positions with inverted list
7. Optimistic UI transitions smoothly from temp → confirmed messages without disappearing
8. Code complexity reduced by removing manual scroll state management (~100 lines deleted)

**Technical Implementation:**

- Message array sorted DESC (newest-first) for inverted list rendering
- FlatList `inverted={true}` with `maintainVisibleContentPosition` for pagination stability
- Pagination changed from `onStartReached` → `onEndReached` (inverted semantics)
- Atomic deduplication in `messages` useMemo prevents race conditions
- Targeted scroll for user-sent messages only (`scrollToOffset` to index 0)
- Date separator double-reverse pattern maintains compatibility

**Performance Improvements:**

- Before: 4+ scroll executions during initial load (visible jank)
- After: 0 automatic scroll executions (React Native handles positioning)
- ~100 lines of scroll management code eliminated
- Simpler, more maintainable codebase
- Industry-standard pattern (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, iMessage)

**Integration Verification:**

- IV1: Read receipt viewability callbacks fire correctly for visible messages (Story 3.3 compatibility)
- IV2: Pagination loads older messages at the correct scroll position without jumping
- IV3: Real-time message arrivals don't interfere with user scrolling or reading
- IV4: AI metadata (categories, sentiment) displays correctly with inverted list
- IV5: Optimistic → confirmed message transitions are seamless without flickering
