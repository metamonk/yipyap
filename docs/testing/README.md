- Persistent chat history after force-quit
- Connection status UI indicators
- Network drop recovery (30s+ outages)
- Sub-1 second sync performance

**Requirements:**

- 2 physical devices with different accounts
- Ability to control network (WiFi/Airplane Mode)

**Duration:** ~20-30 minutes for full test suite

### ðŸ¤– [Daily Agent Auto-Response Testing](./daily-agent-testing.md)

**Purpose:** Test AI-powered automatic FAQ detection and response

**What's Tested:**

- Daily Agent workflow execution
- FAQ template matching with embeddings
- Auto-response generation and sending
- Approval workflow (manual vs. auto)
- Digest summary creation
- Edge Function integration

**Requirements:**

- 2 devices (one creator, one sender)
- FAQ templates configured with embeddings
- Pinecone API access
- Firebase Cloud Functions deployed

**Duration:** ~15-20 minutes (manual trigger) or 1+ hour (scheduled trigger)

## Testing Best Practices

### Before You Start

1. **Check environment variables** - Ensure all API keys are configured
2. **Verify Firebase deployment** - Functions and Edge Functions must be deployed
3. **Test with Firebase Emulator** first (when applicable) for faster iteration
4. **Use separate test accounts** - Don't test with production user data
5. **Document issues immediately** - Take screenshots and note console logs

### During Testing

- **Follow the guide step-by-step** - Don't skip steps
- **Verify expected results** at each checkpoint
- **Check Firebase console** for backend execution logs
- **Monitor network requests** in DevTools (when applicable)
- **Note performance metrics** (sync times, load times, etc.)

### After Testing

- **Report bugs** with full reproduction steps
- **Update test docs** if procedures changed
- **Share results** with the team
- **Clean up test data** if needed

## Troubleshooting Resources

### Common Issues Across Tests

**Symptoms:** Features not working as expected

**General Debug Steps:**

1. Check **Firebase console** for errors
2. Review **Firestore security rules** for permission issues
3. Verify **environment variables** are set correctly
4. Check **console logs** for JavaScript errors
5. Ensure **app is up to date** with latest code
6. Try **clearing app cache/data** and restarting

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues during testing:

1. **Check the troubleshooting section** in the specific test guide
2. **Search related docs** in `docs/architecture/` for technical details
3. **Review Firebase logs** for backend errors
4. **Create a GitHub issue** with:
   - Test guide being followed
   - Step where issue occurred
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Console logs and screenshots
   - Device info (OS, version, etc.)
