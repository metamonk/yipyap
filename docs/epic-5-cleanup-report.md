## Replacement Mapping

| Old (Epic 5) | Removed | New (Epic 6) | Story |
|--------------|---------|--------------|-------|
| `batchApproveSuggestions()` | ✅ | Draft-first editing (no approval needed) | 6.2 |
| `batchRejectSuggestions()` | ✅ | Draft-first editing (no approval needed) | 6.2 |
| "Approve All" button | ✅ | Removed (draft-first only) | 6.2 |
| Approval mode UI | ✅ | `ResponseDraftCard` component | 6.2 |

---

## What We Expected vs. Reality

### Expected (From Story 6.7 Plan)
- ~850 lines of code to remove
- Old "Command Center" UI to remove
- Old "Overnight Summary" to remove
- Deprecated types (OpportunitySummary, BulkOperation, etc.)
- Old digest schema fields
- Extensive approval UI throughout app

### Reality - Phase 1 (Automated Search)
- **~534 lines found** via automated search
- ✅ **No old Command Center UI** (already Epic 6 format)
- ✅ **No old Overnight Summary** (already Meaningful 10)
- ✅ **No deprecated types** (never implemented or already removed)
- ✅ **No old digest fields** (already clean)
- ✅ **Only approval mode in QuickActions** (isolated cleanup)

### Reality - Phase 2 (Manual Testing Discovery) ⚠️
**Critical Finding:** User screenshot revealed Accept/Reject buttons still active in conversation screen!

- **~1,508 additional lines found** via manual testing
- ❌ **ResponseSuggestions.tsx still active** (415 lines of approval UI)
- ❌ **ResponseCard.tsx still active** (169 lines)
- ❌ **MessageInput.tsx using approval workflow** (not draft-first)
- ❌ **Integration tests for approval mode** (518 lines)

### Final Actual Impact ✅
- **~2,042 total lines removed** (more than 2x expected!)
- **5 files completely deleted**
- **7 files modified**
- **All Epic 5 approval UI removed from production**

**Key Lesson:** Automated search missed critical UI components. Manual testing was essential!

## Database Fields (Deprecated but Not Deleted)

The following fields may still exist in **Firestore data** but are **no longer written** by the code:

| Field | Location | Status | Plan |
|-------|----------|--------|------|
| `metadata.approved` | `messages` | ❌ No longer written | Delete in 60 days |
| `metadata.suggestionApproved` | `messages` | ❌ No longer written | Delete in 60 days |
| `metadata.suggestionRejected` | `messages` | ❌ No longer written | Delete in 60 days |
| `metadata.bulkOperationId` | `messages` | ❌ No longer written | Delete in 60 days |

**Safety:** These fields are marked `@deprecated` in code comments but not deleted from database for safety. After Epic 6 is stable for 60 days, we can run a data migration to remove them.

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If cleanup causes issues:

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push
```

### Partial Rollback (Specific File)
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- path/to/file.ts
```

### Restore Deleted Function
All removed code is in git history:
```bash
git show HEAD~1:services/bulkOperationsService.ts
```

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Good Migration Practice:** Epic 6 replaced most Epic 5 code cleanly during implementation
2. **Test Coverage:** Tests caught issues immediately after each removal
3. **Incremental Approach:** Removing Priority 1 → 2 → 3 caught issues early
4. **Verification:** Running tests after each removal prevented big failures
5. **User Involvement:** Manual testing revealed critical missing components

### Critical Lessons ⚠️

1. **Automated Search Limitations:**
   - Grep/search found only 26% of deprecated code (534/2042 lines)
   - Missed active UI components (ResponseSuggestions, ResponseCard)
   - Missed integration tests (voice-non-blocking-ui.test.tsx)

2. **Manual Testing is Essential:**
   - User screenshot revealed Accept/Reject buttons still active
   - Found 1,508 additional lines of deprecated code
   - Discovered MessageInput still using approval workflow

3. **Component Integration Complexity:**
   - ResponseSuggestions was deeply integrated into MessageInput
   - Required replacing entire approval workflow with draft-first
   - Not just removing code, but changing behavior

4. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Need both automated search AND manual testing
   - Visual inspection catches what grep misses
   - End-to-end user flows reveal integration issues

### Recommendations for Future Cleanups

1. **Always do manual testing** before marking cleanup complete
2. **Test actual user workflows** in addition to unit tests
3. **Search for UI components** by looking at screen files, not just grep
4. **Check test files** for integration tests that may reference old code
5. **Two-phase approach:** Automated discovery + Manual verification
