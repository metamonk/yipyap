# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**

- CSP Headers: Not applicable for native mobile apps
- XSS Prevention: React Native's built-in protection against script injection
- Secure Storage: Use expo-secure-store for sensitive data (tokens, credentials)

**Backend Security:**

- Input Validation: Firestore Security Rules validate all data writes
- Rate Limiting: Firebase App Check for API abuse prevention
- CORS Policy: Not applicable (native apps don't use CORS)

**Authentication Security:**

- Token Storage: Secure storage using expo-secure-store
- Session Management: Firebase Auth handles token refresh automatically
- Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters, enforced by Firebase Auth

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**

- Bundle Size Target: < 5MB for initial download
- Loading Strategy: Lazy loading for screens, code splitting with dynamic imports
- Caching Strategy: Firestore offline persistence, image caching with expo-image

**Backend Performance:**

- Response Time Target: < 500ms P95 for message delivery
- Database Optimization: Composite indexes, query limits, pagination
- Caching Strategy: Firestore's built-in caching, CDN for static assets
