# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for yipyap, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Current Status:** This is an existing React Native/Expo project that has been initialized with the Expo managed workflow. The project already has:

- Basic React Native/Expo structure set up
- TypeScript configuration
- Navigation libraries installed (React Navigation)
- Core dependencies for React Native development

No specific starter template was used - this appears to be a standard Expo-initialized project with custom configuration.
