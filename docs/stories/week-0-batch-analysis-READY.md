# ✅ Batch Analysis: READY TO RUN

## Status Update (Oct 26, 2025 - 2:15 AM)

All setup issues resolved! The batch analysis script is now ready to run.

### What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **TypeScript compilation**: Added `scripts` to tsconfig.json
2. ✅ **Service account authentication**: Fixed path resolution for credentials
3. ✅ **Firestore index**: Deployed required index for `recipientId` + `timestamp`

### Index Status

**Index deployed**: Oct 26, 2025 at 2:27 AM ✅
**Status**: 🔨 Building... (takes 2-5 minutes)
**Check status**: https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/yipyap-444/firestore/indexes

---

## Run Batch Analysis (2 Options)

### Option 1: Wait for Index to Build (Recommended)

**Wait**: 2-5 minutes for index to finish building

**Check if ready**:
```bash
# Check index status in Firebase Console
open https://console.firebase.google.com/project/yipyap-444/firestore/indexes

# Look for "recipientId, timestamp" index
# Status should show: ✅ Enabled (green)
```

**Then run**:
```bash
cd /Users/zeno/Projects/yipyap/functions
npm run batch-analysis
```

### Option 2: Check Index Build Status

The index is currently building. You can check its status here:

https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/yipyap-444/firestore/indexes

Look for the `messages` collection index with fields: `recipientId + timestamp`
Status should show: 🔨 Building... → ✅ Enabled (green)

2. Spot-check 50+ digests
3. Validate 80%+ accuracy
```

---

## After Running

### 1. Review Results

```bash
cd /Users/zeno/Projects/yipyap/functions
open results/sample-digests-*.md
```

### 2. Manual Validation

For each sample digest:
- Review top 3 high priority messages
- Ask: "Is this actually important?"
- Mark: ✅ Match or ❌ Mismatch

### 3. Calculate Accuracy

```
Accuracy = Matches / 150 × 100
Target: ≥80% (≥120 matches)
```

### 4. Report Results

Let me know:
- **Accuracy**: ___%
- **Patterns**: What scored too high? What scored too low?
- **Decision**: Proceed to Week 1? Or tune weights?

## Troubleshooting

### "Index still building" error

**Wait**: 2-5 more minutes, then retry
**Or**: Use the auto-create link above (faster)

### "No active creators found"

**Cause**: Not enough historical data in your database

**Fix**: Adjust date range in script
```typescript
// In historical-batch-analysis.ts
daysBack: 7,  // ← Try 7 days instead of 30
```

Then rebuild and re-run:
```bash
npm run build
npm run batch-analysis
```

### Other Errors

See: `docs/stories/week-0-batch-analysis-guide.md` (Troubleshooting section)
