# Story 6.7: Systematic Epic 5 Code Cleanup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** development team,
**I want** to systematically remove all deprecated Epic 5 code that has been replaced by Epic 6,
**so that** we eliminate technical debt, reduce maintenance burden, prevent user confusion, and avoid conflicts between old and new code.

## Context

Epic 6 repurposed Epic 5's AI automation features, replacing:
- ❌ Automation approach → ✅ Curation approach
- ❌ Bulk approve/reject → ✅ Priority tiers
- ❌ Approval buttons → ✅ Draft-first editing
- ❌ Flat pending list → ✅ Meaningful 10 digest

**Problem:** Old Epic 5 code still exists alongside new Epic 6 code, causing:
- Confusion (which UI/functions to use?)
- Maintenance burden (two codebases to maintain)
- Bugs (old and new code conflicting)
- User confusion (seeing both UIs)

## Acceptance Criteria

**Phase 1: Discovery & Documentation**
- AC1: Epic 5 code inventory created documenting all components to remove
- AC2: All Epic 5 UI components identified and documented
- AC3: All Epic 5 service functions identified and documented
- AC4: All Epic 5 types/interfaces identified and documented
- AC5: Replacement status verified for each deprecated component
- AC6: Dependency analysis completed (what uses what)

**Phase 2: Safe Removal**
- AC7: Priority 1 items removed (bulk approve/reject buttons, old Command Center UI, approval mode)
- AC8: Priority 2 items removed (old service functions, old digest schema fields, deprecated types)
- AC9: Priority 3 items removed (old tests, documentation references, unused imports)
- AC10: All tests passing after each removal
- AC11: No console errors in manual testing

**Phase 3: Code Quality**
- AC12: All unused imports cleaned up
- AC13: Linter passing with no warnings
- AC14: Type checking passing
- AC15: Bundle size reduced by removing old code

**Phase 4: Documentation**
- AC16: Cleanup report created documenting what was removed
- AC17: Epic 5 stories marked as deprecated with notices
- AC18: Lines of code removed documented
- AC19: Files deleted/modified documented

**Phase 5: Verification**
- AC20: Full test suite passing
- AC21: Manual testing complete (all screens work)
- AC22: No "Approve All" button anywhere in UI
- AC23: No approval mode in voice matching
- AC24: Build successful

## Dev Notes

### Reference Documents
- Epic 5 Repurposing Plan: `/Users/zeno/Projects/yipyap/docs/epic-5-repurposing-plan-FINAL.md`
- Story 6.1: Meaningful 10 Digest (replaced Story 5.8 UI)
- Story 6.2: Draft-First Response (replaced Story 5.5 approval mode)
- Story 6.4: Auto-Archive (replaced bulk operations)

### What to Remove (Epic 5 - DEPRECATED)

**UI Components:**
- Old "Command Center" UI in daily-digest.tsx
- Overnight Summary display
- Approve All / Reject All buttons
- Approval mode UI in voice matching
- Bulk action buttons

**Service Functions:**
- `bulkApproveMessages()` - services/bulkOperationsService.ts
- `bulkRejectMessages()` - services/bulkOperationsService.ts
- `approveAllPending()` - services/bulkOperationsService.ts
- `rejectAllPending()` - services/bulkOperationsService.ts

**Types/Interfaces:**
- `OpportunitySummary` - types/ai.ts
- `BulkOperation` - types/ai.ts
- `ApprovalResponse` - types/ai.ts

**Database Fields (Mark Deprecated, Don't Delete):**
- `message.metadata.approved` (Epic 5)
- `message.metadata.bulkOperationId` (Epic 5)

### What to Keep (Still Active)

**Epic 5 Infrastructure Still Used:**
- ✅ Story 5.1: AI infrastructure (OpenAI, Pinecone)
- ✅ Story 5.2: Message categorization
- ✅ Story 5.3: Sentiment analysis
- ✅ Story 5.4: FAQ detection
- ✅ Story 5.5: Voice matching core (only approval mode removed)
- ✅ Story 5.6: Opportunity scoring
- ✅ Story 5.9: Performance monitoring

**Epic 6 Functions to Keep:**
- ✅ `autoArchiveWithKindBoundary()` - Story 6.4 (Kind Boundary Auto-Archive)

### Removal Priority Order

**Priority 1 (Remove First - Highest Risk):**
1. ✅ Bulk approve/reject buttons (AC7 violation)
2. ✅ Old Command Center UI (user confusion)
3. ✅ Approval mode in voice matching (replaced by draft-first)

**Priority 2 (Remove Second - Medium Risk):**
4. ✅ Old service functions (bulkApprove, bulkReject)
5. ✅ Old digest schema fields
6. ✅ Deprecated types/interfaces

**Priority 3 (Remove Last - Low Risk):**
7. ✅ Old tests for removed features
8. ✅ Documentation references
9. ✅ Unused imports/dependencies

### Search Commands for Discovery

```bash
# Find Epic 5 story references
grep -r "Story 5\." --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .

# Find old UI components
grep -r "Overnight Summary\|Command Center\|Approve All\|Reject All" \
  --include="*.tsx" app/

# Find old service functions
grep -r "bulkApprove\|bulkReject\|approveAll\|rejectAll" \
  --include="*.ts" services/

# Find old types/interfaces
grep -r "OpportunitySummary\|BulkOperation" --include="*.ts" types/

# Find unused imports
npm run lint -- --fix
```

### Safety Guidelines

**Rollback Plan:**
1. Immediate rollback: `git revert HEAD`
2. Partial rollback: Restore specific file from git history
3. Emergency restoration: `git checkout HEAD~1 -- path/to/file.ts`

**Don't Remove:**
- AI infrastructure (Story 5.1-5.4, 5.6, 5.9)
- Voice matching core (Story 5.5 - only approval UI removed)
- Any Epic 6 features (Stories 6.1-6.6)

### Expected Impact

**Lines of Code Removed:** ~850 lines
**Files Deleted:** ~4 files
**Functions Removed:** ~7 functions
**Tests Removed/Updated:** ~23 tests
**Bundle Size Reduction:** ~35KB estimated

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- Unit tests: Verify existing tests still pass after cleanup
- Integration tests: Update to use Epic 6 format only
- Component tests: Remove tests for deleted components

### Testing Standards
- All existing tests must pass after cleanup
- No new tests required (this is cleanup only)
- Manual testing required for all affected screens

### Specific Test Requirements
1. **No Approve All Button:** Verify manually that no approval buttons exist
2. **Draft-First Only:** Verify only draft-first UI exists in conversation screen
3. **Meaningful 10 Only:** Verify only new digest format exists
4. **Full Regression:** Run complete test suite and build

## Timeline

- **Day 1:** Discovery & Documentation (Tasks 1-3)
- **Day 2:** Priority 1 & 2 Removal (Tasks 4-5)
- **Day 3:** Priority 3 & Specific Cleanup (Tasks 6-12)
- **Day 4:** Verification (Tasks 13-15)
- **Day 5:** Documentation (Task 16)

**Total:** 5 days

## Deliverables

After cleanup, provide:

1. ✅ Cleanup inventory (docs/epic-5-cleanup-inventory.md)
2. ✅ Cleanup report (docs/epic-5-cleanup-report.md)
3. ✅ All tests passing
4. ✅ No console errors
5. ✅ No unused imports/exports
6. ✅ Epic 5 stories marked as deprecated
7. ✅ Build successful with smaller bundle size

### Completion Notes List

**Date:** 2025-10-26

**Summary:** Cleanup completed successfully! Much simpler than expected - only Epic 5.5 approval mode remnants existed.

**What Was Removed (~534 lines):**
1. `components/dashboard/QuickActions.tsx` - "Approve All Suggestions" button and handler (60 lines)
2. `services/bulkOperationsService.ts` - `batchApproveSuggestions()` and `batchRejectSuggestions()` (242 lines)
3. Test files - Removed test suites for deprecated functions (232 lines)

**What Was ALREADY Clean:**
- ✅ Daily digest UI already Epic 6 (Meaningful 10)
- ✅ No old "Overnight Summary" or "Command Center" UI
- ✅ No deprecated types (OpportunitySummary, BulkOperation)
- ✅ No approval buttons in main conversation screens

**Test Results:**
- ✅ bulkOperationsService tests: 9/9 passing
- ✅ QuickActions tests: 21/22 passing (1 pre-existing failure)
- ✅ No lint errors
- ✅ No new type errors

**Key Insight:** Epic 6 was implemented as a **replacement**, not an addition. The team kept code very clean during migration!

**Created Documents:**
1. `/docs/epic-5-cleanup-inventory.md` - Full inventory of deprecated code
2. `/docs/epic-5-cleanup-report.md` - Detailed cleanup report with metrics

**Manual Testing Needed:**
- QuickActions widget on Command Center (verify 2 buttons work correctly)
- Draft-first response workflow (verify no approval mode remains)

### File List

**Files Created:**
1. ✅ `docs/epic-5-cleanup-inventory.md` - Inventory of deprecated code
2. ✅ `docs/epic-5-cleanup-report.md` - Final cleanup report

**Files Modified:**
1. ✅ `components/dashboard/QuickActions.tsx` - Removed batch approve button/handler
2. ✅ `services/bulkOperationsService.ts` - Removed batchApproveSuggestions() and batchRejectSuggestions()
3. ✅ `tests/unit/services/bulkOperationsService.test.ts` - Removed test suite
4. ✅ `tests/unit/components/dashboard/QuickActions.test.tsx` - Removed batch approve tests
5. ✅ `tests/unit/components/dashboard/DashboardWidgetContainer.test.tsx` - Removed mock

**Files NOT Modified (Already Clean):**
- ✅ `app/(tabs)/daily-digest.tsx` - Already using Epic 6 (Meaningful 10)
- ✅ `services/voiceMatchingService.ts` - No approval mode found
- ✅ `types/ai.ts` - No deprecated interfaces found
