# Story 2.8: Search Messages by Keyword

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to search for messages by keyword across all my conversations,
**so that** I can quickly find specific information from past chats.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Search icon in conversation list header opens search interface
2. Search input field accepts text keywords and searches across all user's conversations
3. Firestore query searches message text field using appropriate query strategy (note: Firestore doesn't support full-text search natively—may require client-side filtering or Algolia integration for advanced search)
4. Search results display matching messages with conversation context (sender, conversation name, timestamp)
5. Tapping search result navigates to conversation and scrolls to the specific message (message highlighted temporarily)
6. Search is case-insensitive and finds partial matches (substring search)
7. Search results update as user types (debounced to avoid excessive queries)
8. Empty search results display "No messages found" message
9. Search interface includes clear/cancel button to exit search and return to conversation list
10. TypeScript types defined for search results and search state management

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 2.7: Message Timestamps & Date Separators**:

- ⚠️ Story 2.7 is still in Draft status (not completed)
- Date separator and timestamp formatting utilities exist in `/utils/dateHelpers.ts`
- `formatRelativeTime()` can be used for search result timestamps

**From Story 2.6: Offline Support**:

- Offline detection and handling already implemented
- Messages cached locally via Firestore persistence
- Search should work on cached messages when offline

**From Story 2.5: Message Persistence with Pagination**:

- Messages loaded in batches of 50 using cursor-based pagination
- `useMessages()` hook manages loaded messages
- Search will only operate on loaded messages (not full history)
- Users must scroll/load more messages to expand search scope

**From Story 2.3: Real-Time 1:1 Chat View**:

- Chat view uses inverted FlatList for message display
- `useMessages()` hook provides messages array and loading states
- MessageItem component renders individual messages
- Auto-scroll to bottom functionality exists (can adapt for scroll-to-message)

**From Story 2.2: Conversation List View**:

- Conversation list implemented in `/app/(tabs)/conversations/index.tsx`
- Uses FlatList with ConversationItem components
- Empty state handling already implemented
- Navigation to individual conversations works

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/conversations-messages-data-model.md]

**Message Interface:**

```typescript
interface Message {
  id: string; // Firestore document ID
  conversationId: string; // Parent conversation ID
  senderId: string; // User ID of sender
  text: string; // Message content (1-1000 chars) - SEARCHABLE FIELD
  status: 'sending' | 'delivered' | 'read';
  readBy: string[];
  timestamp: Timestamp; // Firestore Timestamp
  metadata: {
    category?: string; // AI-ready for Phase 2
    sentiment?: string; // AI-ready for Phase 2
    aiProcessed?: boolean;
  };
}
```

**Conversation Interface:**

```typescript
interface Conversation {
  id: string;
  participantIds: string[]; // Array of user IDs
  lastMessage: {
    text: string;
    senderId: string;
    timestamp: Timestamp;
  };
  lastMessageTimestamp: Timestamp;
  unreadCount: { [userId: string]: number };
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

### Search Implementation Details

[Source: Architecture analysis and Firestore limitations]

**Why Client-Side Search:**

- Firestore does not support full-text search natively
- No LIKE operator or regex queries available
- Server-side search would require third-party service (Algolia, Elastic)
- For MVP, client-side filtering is sufficient and simpler
- Document limitation for future enhancement

**Search Algorithm (Client-Side):**

```typescript
// utils/searchHelpers.ts
export function filterMessagesByKeyword(messages: Message[], query: string): Message[] {
  const normalizedQuery = query.toLowerCase().trim();

  if (!normalizedQuery) {
    return messages;
  }

  return messages.filter((message) => message.text.toLowerCase().includes(normalizedQuery));
}
```

**Search Scope Limitations:**

- Only searches messages currently loaded in memory
- Does not search entire conversation history
- Limited by pagination (50 messages initially loaded)
- Users must load more messages to expand search scope

**Performance Optimizations:**

- Debounce search input (300ms) to reduce filtering frequency
- Use `useMemo()` to memoize filtered results
- Convert to lowercase once for comparison efficiency
- Limit to loaded messages (no additional Firestore queries)

---

### Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/components.md, architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**SearchBar Component:**

```typescript
interface SearchBarProps {
  onSearch: (query: string) => void;
  onClear: () => void;
  placeholder?: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
  testID?: string;
}
```

**SearchResultItem Component:**

```typescript
interface SearchResultItemProps {
  message: Message;
  conversationName: string;
  senderName: string;
  senderPhotoURL?: string;
  onPress: () => void;
  testID?: string;
}
```

**Search Hook Interface:**

```typescript
interface UseMessageSearchResult {
  searchResults: Message[];
  searchQuery: string;
  isSearching: boolean;
  searchMessages: (query: string) => void;
  clearSearch: () => void;
}
```

### State Management Pattern

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Tech Stack:**

- Zustand for global state (if needed for cross-component search)
- Local React state with hooks for component-specific search
- `useMemo()` for memoized computations
- `useCallback()` for memoized callbacks

**Search State Structure:**

```typescript
interface SearchState {
  query: string;
  results: Message[];
  isSearching: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

---

### Styling Guidelines

[Source: Existing components - MessageInput, MessageItem, ConversationItem]

**Color Palette:**

```typescript
const COLORS = {
  primary: '#007AFF', // iOS blue
  background: '#FFFFFF',
  secondaryBg: '#F2F2F7', // Input background
  border: '#E5E5EA',
  text: '#000000',
  secondaryText: '#8E8E93', // Placeholder, timestamps
  disabled: '#C7C7CC',
  error: '#FF3B30',
};
```

**Component Styling:**

- Border radius: 20px for inputs, 18px for bubbles
- Padding: 12px standard, 16px for inputs
- Font sizes: 16px body, 14px secondary, 12px metadata
- Icons: 20-24px size (Ionicons)
- Use StyleSheet.create() for performance

---

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

#### Testing Requirements

**Coverage Targets:**

- Unit Tests: Minimum 80% coverage for utils and components
- Integration Tests: Cover complete search workflow
- E2E Tests: Basic smoke test for search functionality

**Test Frameworks:**

- Jest 29.x for unit testing
- React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Firebase Emulator for integration tests
- @testing-library/react-hooks for hook testing

**Test Data:**

```typescript
// Test message factory
export const createTestMessage = (overrides = {}): Message => ({
  id: 'test-msg-1',
  conversationId: 'test-conv-1',
  senderId: 'test-user-1',
  text: 'Test message content',
  status: 'delivered',
  readBy: ['test-user-1'],
  timestamp: Timestamp.now(),
  metadata: {},
  ...overrides,
});
```

**Key Test Cases:**

1. Search input debouncing (300ms)
2. Case-insensitive matching
3. Substring/partial matching
4. Empty query handling
5. No results state
6. Navigation to message
7. Message highlighting
8. Clear/cancel functionality

---

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**MANDATORY Requirements:**

1. **JSDoc/TSDoc:** All public functions and components must have complete documentation
2. **Type Safety:** No `any` types, proper TypeScript interfaces for all data
3. **Error Handling:** Try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
4. **Service Layer:** Don't access Firestore directly (though search is client-side)
5. **State Management:** Never mutate state directly
6. **Performance:** Use memo() and useMemo() for optimization
7. **Testing:** Minimum 80% code coverage
8. **Accessibility:** Include testID attributes for all interactive elements

**Documentation Example:**

````typescript
/**
 * Filters messages by keyword using case-insensitive substring matching
 *
 * @param messages - Array of messages to search through
 * @param query - Search keyword(s) to match
 * @returns Filtered array of messages matching the query
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const messages = [msg1, msg2, msg3];
 * const results = filterMessagesByKeyword(messages, 'hello');
 * // Returns messages containing 'hello' (case-insensitive)
 * ```
 */
````

---

### Performance Considerations

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md, existing useMessages hook]

**Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Debouncing:** 300ms delay on search input to reduce filtering frequency
2. **Memoization:** Use `useMemo()` for filtered results to prevent unnecessary recalculations
3. **Lazy Loading:** Only search loaded messages (no additional Firestore reads)
4. **FlatList Optimizations:** Use existing windowSize, maxToRenderPerBatch settings
5. **Component Memoization:** Use `React.memo()` for SearchResultItem components

**Performance Metrics:**

- Search filtering should complete in <50ms for 1000 messages
- Debouncing reduces search operations by ~80%
- No additional Firestore reads for search (uses cached data)

---

### Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

**Note:** Document these limitations for future improvement:

1. **Full-Text Search Service:**
   - Integrate Algolia or Elasticsearch
   - Server-side search across all conversations
   - Advanced search operators (AND, OR, NOT)

2. **Search Filters:**
   - Filter by sender
   - Filter by date range
   - Filter by conversation

3. **Search History:**
   - Save recent searches
   - Search suggestions/autocomplete

4. **AI-Enhanced Search:**
   - Semantic search using embeddings
   - Search by message sentiment/category
   - Natural language queries

---

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]

- Search only operates on messages user has access to (participant in conversation)
- No server-side search API to secure (client-side only for MVP)
- Firestore Security Rules already enforce access control
- No sensitive data exposed in search results beyond what user can already access

Future enhancements to consider:

- [ ] Monitor and optimize performance for users with 10+ conversations
- [ ] Consider pagination for cross-conversation message loading
- [ ] Future Phase 2: Integrate server-side search (Algolia/Elasticsearch) for full history search
- [ ] Future Phase 2: Add search filters (by sender, date range, conversation)

### Security Review

**Assessment: PASS**

Search functionality maintains existing security posture:

- ✅ Only searches messages user already has access to (participant in conversation)
- ✅ No new API endpoints exposed (client-side only)
- ✅ Firestore Security Rules continue to enforce access control
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed beyond existing access levels
- ✅ No authentication or authorization bypass concerns
- ✅ Search operates on locally cached data only

**Findings:** No security concerns identified.

### Performance Considerations

**Assessment: CONCERNS (Monitor in Production)**

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Excellent debouncing (300ms) reduces search operations by ~80%
- ✅ Proper memoization with useMemo prevents unnecessary recalculations
- ✅ Component memoization with React.memo
- ✅ Performance test validates <50ms filtering for 1000 messages
- ✅ No additional Firestore reads during search (uses cached data)
- ✅ Offline-first approach leverages Firestore persistence

**Concerns:**

- ⚠️ **Cross-conversation search loads 50 messages from each conversation**
  - For users with 20+ conversations, this could load 1000+ messages
  - Initial load could be slow and consume significant Firestore bandwidth
  - Risk Level: Medium - May impact users with many conversations
  - Mitigation: Monitor usage patterns; consider lazy loading or pagination

**Recommendations:**

1. Monitor Firestore read counts in production for cross-conversation search
2. Consider adding user-facing loading indicator for initial message load
3. Future: Implement pagination or limit to recent N conversations
4. Future: Add analytics to track search usage patterns

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this QA review. All code met quality standards.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/2.8-search-messages-by-keyword.yml

**Reason:** Performance concerns for users with many conversations require production monitoring, but implementation is otherwise excellent.

### Recommended Status

**✓ Ready for Done** (with monitoring plan)

The story successfully implements all 10 acceptance criteria with high code quality, comprehensive testing, and strong adherence to standards. The performance concern is a "monitor in production" issue rather than a blocking defect. The MVP approach of client-side search is appropriate and well-documented for future enhancement.

**Recommendation:** Mark as Done and create monitoring task for Phase 2 to track cross-conversation search performance metrics.
