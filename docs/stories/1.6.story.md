# Story 1.6: Firebase Security Rules for User Data

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** platform administrator,
**I want** Firebase Security Rules configured to protect user data,
**so that** users can only access and modify their own profile information.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Firestore Security Rules deployed for users collection
2. Users can read only their own user document (authenticated user ID matches document ID)
3. Users can write/update only their own user document
4. Username uniqueness validation rule prevents duplicate usernames during profile creation
5. Firebase Storage Security Rules ensure users can upload only to their own profile photo path
6. Unauthenticated requests to Firestore and Storage are denied
7. Security rules tested using Firebase Emulator Suite with passing test cases
8. Security rules documentation added to repository with explanation of access patterns

## Dev Notes

### üéØ Story Focus: Testing and Documentation of Security Rules

This story focuses on **testing, validation, and documentation** of Firebase Security Rules that have already been implemented. The rules exist in `/firebase/firestore.rules` and `/firebase/storage.rules` but lack comprehensive test coverage and documentation.

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours (setting up emulator, writing tests, documentation)

**Implementation Status:**

- ‚úÖ Firestore security rules exist: `/firebase/firestore.rules`
- ‚úÖ Storage security rules exist: `/firebase/storage.rules`
- ‚úÖ Users collection rules implemented (read/write own document only)
- ‚úÖ Usernames collection rules implemented (uniqueness validation)
- ‚úÖ Storage rules implemented (profile photos)
- ‚ùå **Firebase Emulator Suite not configured**
- ‚ùå **Security rules tests missing** - Primary focus of this story
- ‚ùå **Security rules documentation missing** - Secondary focus of this story

---

### Previous Story Insights

From Stories 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5:

- ‚úÖ Firebase fully configured in `/services/firebase.ts`
- ‚úÖ Auth service layer uses Firebase Auth for user authentication
- ‚úÖ User service creates user documents in Firestore users collection
- ‚úÖ Username uniqueness validation implemented via usernames collection
- ‚úÖ Profile photo upload using Firebase Storage at path: `users/{userId}/profile.jpg`
- ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type definitions
- ‚úÖ Testing infrastructure in place (Jest, React Native Testing Library)

**Key Integration Points:**

- `services/userService.ts` creates user documents after registration (Story 1.4)
- `services/userService.ts` checks username availability via usernames collection
- `services/storageService.ts` uploads profile photos to Storage (Story 1.4)
- All operations rely on security rules for access control

---

### Firebase Security Rules - Overview

[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#Security-Requirements]

Firebase Security Rules provide **server-side validation** and **access control** for Firestore and Storage. Rules run on Firebase servers BEFORE any read/write operation, ensuring data protection regardless of client code.

**Key Principles:**

- **Deny by default**: Explicitly deny all undefined paths
- **Authentication required**: Most operations require authenticated user
- **Path-based access control**: Rules match document paths and validate auth.uid
- **Data validation**: Rules can validate request data structure and content
- **Server-side enforcement**: Cannot be bypassed by client code

---

### Existing Firestore Security Rules

[Source: firebase/firestore.rules]

**Current Rules Implementation:**

```javascript
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Users collection - users can only read/write their own profile
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Users can read their own profile
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;

      // Users can write (create/update) their own profile
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Username uniqueness collection
    match /usernames/{username} {
      // Anyone can read usernames to check availability (usernames are public identifiers)
      allow read: if true;

      // Users can only create their own username claim
      // The uid in the document must match the authenticated user
      allow create: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.uid;

      // Prevent deletion or update of username claims
      // Usernames are permanent once created
      allow update, delete: if false;
    }

    // Default deny all other access
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

**Rules Explanation:**

1. **Users Collection** (AC: 2, 3):
   - Read: Authenticated user can only read their own document (auth.uid matches userId)
   - Write: Authenticated user can only create/update their own document
   - Prevents cross-user data access

2. **Usernames Collection** (AC: 4):
   - Read: Public read access for username availability checks
   - Create: User can only claim username if uid matches authenticated user
   - Update/Delete: Permanently disabled (usernames immutable)
   - Prevents duplicate username claims by different users

3. **Default Deny** (AC: 6):
   - Explicitly denies all access to undefined paths
   - Ensures unauthenticated requests are blocked

---

### Existing Storage Security Rules

[Source: firebase/storage.rules]

**Current Rules Implementation:**

```javascript
rules_version = '2';

service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {

    // Profile photos - users can only upload to their own folder
    match /users/{userId}/profile.jpg {
      // Any authenticated user can read profile photos
      allow read: if request.auth != null;

      // Users can only write (upload/update/delete) their own profile photo
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Default deny all other access
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

**Rules Explanation:**

1. **Profile Photos** (AC: 5):
   - Read: Any authenticated user can view profile photos (public within app)
   - Write: User can only upload/update/delete their own profile photo
   - Path structure: `users/{userId}/profile.jpg` enforces user-specific uploads

2. **Default Deny** (AC: 6):
   - Explicitly denies all access to undefined paths
   - Ensures unauthenticated requests are blocked

### Firestore Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md, architecture/database-schema.md]

**User Document Structure:**

```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string; // Firebase Auth UID
  username: string; // Unique username (3-20 chars, lowercase)
  displayName: string; // Display name (up to 50 chars)
  photoURL?: string; // Firebase Storage URL for profile photo
  fcmToken?: string; // FCM token for push notifications
  presence: {
    status: 'online' | 'offline';
    lastSeen: firebase.firestore.Timestamp;
  };
  settings: {
    sendReadReceipts: boolean;
    notificationsEnabled: boolean;
  };
  createdAt: firebase.firestore.Timestamp;
  updatedAt: firebase.firestore.Timestamp;
}
```

**Username Document Structure:**

```typescript
interface UsernameDocument {
  uid: string; // Points to the user who owns this username
}
```

**Collection Paths:**

- Users: `/users/{userId}` where userId = Firebase Auth UID
- Usernames: `/usernames/{username}` where username = lowercase username string

      },
    });
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await testEnv.cleanup();
  });

  describe('Users Collection', () => {
    it('allows user to read their own document', async () => {
      const alice = testEnv.authenticatedContext('alice-uid');
      await assertSucceeds(alice.firestore().collection('users').doc('alice-uid').get());
    });

    it('denies user from reading another user document', async () => {

### Security Review

**Critical Security Findings**: None

**Security Concerns Identified**:

1. **SEC-001 (Medium)**: Firestore rules lack data validation
   - **Finding**: Rules don't validate document structure (required fields, data types)
   - **Risk**: Malicious clients could write invalid data structures
   - **Example**: User document could be created without required fields like `username` or `uid`
   - **Recommendation**: Add data validation rules:
     ```javascript
     allow write: if request.auth != null &&
                     request.auth.uid == userId &&
                     request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['uid', 'username', 'displayName']) &&
                     request.resource.data.uid is string &&
                     request.resource.data.username.size() >= 3 &&
                     request.resource.data.username.size() <= 20;
     ```
   - **Status**: Recommend addressing before production for data integrity

2. **SEC-002 (Medium)**: Storage rules lack file validation
   - **Finding**: No file size or content type validation
   - **Risk**: Users could upload arbitrarily large files or non-image files
   - **Impact**: Storage cost abuse, potential security issues with non-image files
   - **Recommendation**: Add size and type validation:
     ```javascript
     allow write: if request.auth != null &&
                     request.auth.uid == userId &&
                     request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024 && // 5MB limit
                     request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
     ```
   - **Status**: Recommend addressing before production for cost control

**Security Strengths**:

- ‚úÖ Excellent access control enforcement
- ‚úÖ Proper authentication validation on all sensitive operations
- ‚úÖ Deny-by-default strategy prevents unauthorized access
- ‚úÖ Username immutability prevents account takeover scenarios
- ‚úÖ Cross-user access properly blocked

### Performance Considerations

**Current Performance**: Good

- Test execution is fast (2.2 seconds for 35 tests)
- Security rules are simple and should execute quickly in production

**Potential Concerns**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Username availability checks are public reads - could be rate-limited in production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No quota limits on user uploads (Storage rules don't limit number of uploads)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Java version warning: Firebase Emulator will require Java 21+ in future (currently using Java 17)

**Recommendations**:

- Consider adding rate limiting for username availability API in future
- Monitor Storage quota usage per user in production
- Plan Java 21+ upgrade before firebase-tools@15 release

### Technical Debt Identified

1. **TD-001 (Low)**: Test helper functions not extracted
   - **Debt**: Repeated admin context setup code in both test files
   - **Impact**: Minor - affects maintainability, not functionality
   - **Effort**: ~30 minutes to refactor
   - **Recommendation**: Extract to shared helpers when adding more test files

2. **TD-002 (Low)**: Test constants not centralized
   - **Debt**: Test UIDs ('alice-uid', 'bob-uid') and buffer data hardcoded
   - **Impact**: Minor - affects consistency if values need to change
   - **Effort**: ~15 minutes to create constants file
   - **Recommendation**: Address when test suite grows

3. **TD-003 (Medium)**: Java version will need upgrade
   - **Debt**: Using Java 17, but firebase-tools@15 will require Java 21+
   - **Impact**: Future blocker for Firebase CLI updates
   - **Effort**: ~1 hour (install, test, document)
   - **Recommendation**: Upgrade to Java 21 proactively

4. **TD-004 (High)**: Security rules lack data validation
   - **Debt**: As noted in SEC-001 and SEC-002
   - **Impact**: Data integrity and cost control risks
   - **Effort**: ~2-3 hours (rules + tests + deployment)
   - **Recommendation**: Address before production launch

### Improvements Checklist

- ‚úÖ Validates all required fields (8 fields): uid, username, displayName, email, presence, settings, createdAt, updatedAt
- ‚úÖ Username format validation: regex `^[a-z0-9_]+$`, length 3-20 chars, lowercase only
- ‚úÖ DisplayName length validation: 1-50 characters
- ‚úÖ Email validation: non-empty string
- ‚úÖ Presence object validation: status enum ('online'|'offline'), lastSeen timestamp
- ‚úÖ Settings object validation: boolean fields (sendReadReceipts, notificationsEnabled)
- ‚úÖ Timestamp validation: createdAt, updatedAt must be timestamps
- ‚úÖ Optional fields validation: photoURL and fcmToken (if present, must be strings)
- ‚úÖ UID validation: must match authenticated user's UID

**Test Coverage**:

- 14 new validation tests added (`tests/rules/firestore.test.ts:165-290`)
- Tests cover: missing fields, invalid uid, username too short/long, invalid username format (uppercase, special chars), valid username with underscore, displayName too long/empty, invalid presence status, missing presence.lastSeen, invalid settings type, optional fields (photoURL, fcmToken)
- All 14 tests passing ‚úÖ

**Code Quality**:

- Validation rules are comprehensive and correctly implemented
- Clear inline comments explain each validation rule

#### ‚úÖ SEC-002: Storage File Validation - **FULLY RESOLVED**

**Original Finding**: Storage rules lacked file size and content type validation, allowing large file uploads and non-image files.

**Resolution Implemented**:

- ‚úÖ File size limit added: 5MB maximum (`request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024`)
- ‚úÖ Content type validation: images only (`request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*')`)
- ‚úÖ Delete operations separated from create/update (no validation needed for deletes)
- ‚úÖ Allows: image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif, image/webp, etc.
- ‚úÖ Blocks: text/plain, application/pdf, video/mp4, files without content type

**Test Coverage**:

- 11 new file validation tests added (`tests/rules/storage.test.ts:207-337`)
- Tests cover: valid size under 5MB, file exceeding 5MB, image/jpeg allowed, image/png allowed, image/gif allowed, text/plain denied, application/pdf denied, video/mp4 denied, no content type denied, update with valid size/type, update exceeding size limit
- All 11 tests passing ‚úÖ

**Code Quality**:

- Validation rules are concise and effective
- Clear separation of delete vs create/update operations
- Documentation updated with file size and content type examples

**Impact**: Prevents storage cost abuse, ensures only valid image files uploaded, blocks malicious file types

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è TD-001: Test Helper Functions - **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**

**Original Finding**: Test code had duplication in admin context setup and test data creation.

**Resolution Implemented**:

- ‚úÖ Helper function `createValidUserData()` added to `tests/rules/firestore.test.ts` (lines 29-48)
- ‚úÖ Significantly reduces duplication in Firestore tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor duplication remains in admin context setup (acceptable for current test suite size)

**Remaining Work**: Extract admin context setup to shared helper file when test suite grows (low priority, not blocking)
