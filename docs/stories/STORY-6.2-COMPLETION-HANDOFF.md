## 🎯 Next Story: Story 6.3 (Basic Capacity Settings)

**Status**: 📋 **READY TO START**

### Overview
**User Story:**
> As a creator, I want to set my daily response capacity (5-20 messages), so that the system respects my realistic limits and helps me avoid burnout.

### Key Features:
1. Capacity slider (5-20 messages/day)
2. Suggested capacity calculation: `Math.round(avgDailyMessages * 0.18)`
3. Time commitment estimate (capacity × 2 min)
4. Distribution preview (X deep, Y FAQ, Z archived)
5. Settings persistence to Firestore

### Estimated Effort:
- **Backend**: 2 days (3 tasks)
- **Frontend**: 2.5 days (4 tasks)
- **Total**: ~4-5 days with full test coverage

### Tasks Breakdown:
- [ ] Task 1: Extend User Settings Schema (8 tests)
- [ ] Task 2: Calculate Suggested Capacity (5 tests)
- [ ] Task 3: Calculate Distribution Preview (5 tests)
- [ ] Task 4: Create Capacity Settings Screen (10 tests)
- [ ] Task 5: Implement Settings Persistence (5 tests)
- [ ] Task 6: Add Link from Profile (minimal tests)
- [ ] Task 7: End-to-End Testing

**Total Estimated Tests**: ~35 tests

## 🔗 Integration Points for Story 6.3

### Existing Infrastructure to Reuse (80%):

1. **User Settings Schema** (exists)
   - Location: `types/user.ts`
   - Need to extend with `capacity` field

2. **Settings Service** (exists)
   - Location: `services/userService.ts`
   - Already handles Firestore persistence

3. **Daily Digest** (exists - Story 6.1)
   - Location: `services/dailyDigestService.ts`
   - Already respects capacity limits
   - **Integration**: Capacity settings will control digest generation

4. **Profile Settings Screen** (exists)
   - Location: `app/(tabs)/profile/settings.tsx`
   - Need to add link to new Capacity Settings screen

### New Components Needed:

1. **Capacity Settings Screen**
   - File: `app/(tabs)/profile/capacity-settings.tsx`
   - Components: Slider, time estimate, distribution preview
   - Use native Slider component

2. **Capacity Calculation Functions**
   - Location: New file or extend `services/dailyDigestService.ts`
   - `suggestCapacity()`: Calculate suggested capacity
   - `previewDistribution()`: Show impact preview

## 🚀 Quick Start for Story 6.3 Agent

### Before Starting:

1. **Read Story 6.3 Requirements:**
   ```bash
   cat docs/stories/6.3.story.md
   ```

2. **Review Existing User Settings:**
   ```bash
   cat types/user.ts | grep -A 20 "interface UserSettings"
   cat services/userService.ts | grep -A 10 "updateUserSettings"
   ```

3. **Check Daily Digest Integration:**
   ```bash
   cat services/dailyDigestService.ts | grep -i "capacity"
   ```

4. **Run Existing Tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test -- tests/unit/services/userService.test.ts
   npm test -- tests/unit/services/dailyDigestService.test.ts
   ```

### Implementation Order (Recommended):

1. **Day 1**: Backend
   - Task 1: Extend User Settings Schema
   - Task 2: Calculate Suggested Capacity
   - Task 3: Calculate Distribution Preview
   - Write all backend tests

2. **Day 2-3**: Frontend
   - Task 4: Create Capacity Settings Screen
   - Task 5: Implement Settings Persistence
   - Write all component tests

3. **Day 4**: Integration & Testing
   - Task 6: Add Profile Link
   - Task 7: End-to-End Testing
   - Verify digest respects new capacity

4. **Day 5**: Polish & Documentation
   - Update story status
   - Update Epic 6 document
   - Verify all tests passing

## 💡 Implementation Tips for 6.3

### Use Story 6.2 Patterns:

1. **Modal Presentation** (if needed):
   ```typescript
   presentationStyle="pageSheet"  // iOS-native smooth animations
   ```

2. **Native Components**:
   ```typescript
   import { Slider } from '@react-native-community/slider'  // For capacity slider
   ```

3. **Settings Persistence**:
   ```typescript
   // Debounce slider changes (like draft auto-save)
   const debouncedSave = useCallback(
     debounce((value) => saveSettings(value), 1000),
     []
   );
   ```

4. **Test Structure**:
   - Follow the pattern from `ResponseDraftCard.test.tsx`
   - Use `beforeEach` for setup
   - Group tests by feature area
   - Mock Firebase services

### Reuse from Story 6.1:

- **Relationship Scoring**: Already implemented
- **Daily Digest Generation**: Already respects capacity
- **Message Categorization**: Already working

**Key Integration**: The capacity setting from 6.3 will be read by the daily digest workflow that was built in Story 6.1. The integration point already exists!
