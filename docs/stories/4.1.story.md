# Story 4.1: Create Group Chats with Multiple Participants

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to create group chats with multiple participants (3-50 users),
**so that** I can have multi-person conversations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Unified conversation creation screen (`/conversations/new`) automatically detects group mode when 2+ recipients selected
2. Group creation flow allows selecting 2+ other users (minimum 3 total including creator)
3. Maximum 50 participants enforced during recipient selection (validation with error message if exceeded)
4. Required group name field appears automatically when multiple recipients selected (max 50 characters)
5. Group photo upload available optionally during creation and later in group settings
6. Firestore conversation document created with type='group', participantIds array, groupName, and groupPhotoURL
7. All participants receive notification/update that they've been added to new group
8. Group chat displays in conversation list for all participants after first message sent
9. Group chat view shows group name and photo in header (instead of 1:1 participant name)
10. TypeScript interfaces updated to support group-specific fields in Conversation type

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**From Story 3.7: Unread Message Badge Counts**

Story 3.7 completed the notification infrastructure including badge count management. This infrastructure will be leveraged for group chat notifications when messages are sent.

Key insights:

- `unreadCount` map structure already supports multiple participants (perfect for groups)
- Real-time Firestore listeners use `array-contains` for participantIds (already group-compatible)
- Notification service handles push notifications to multiple recipients

**From Story 2.1-2.6: Core Messaging Infrastructure**

The existing conversation and message infrastructure is built to support both 1:1 and group conversations:

- `Conversation.type` field distinguishes 'direct' vs 'group'
- `participantIds` is an array (not limited to 2 users)
- Message subcollections are conversation-scoped (works for any participant count)

[Source: Story 3.7 Dev Notes, Story 2.3 Dev Notes]

### Architecture Context

#### Unified Conversation Creation Architecture

**IMPORTANT:** The unified conversation creation system is documented in detail at `docs/architecture/unified-conversation-architecture.md`. This architecture consolidates direct and group messaging flows into a single intelligent interface.

Key components from the unified architecture:

- **RecipientTokenField**: Multi-select component for recipient selection with chip rendering
- **UserSearchDropdown**: Real-time filtered search results with debouncing
- **GroupNameInput**: Conditional component shown only for group conversations
- **ContactPickerModal**: Alternative selection method for contacts

The unified screen at `app/(tabs)/conversations/new.tsx` implements progressive disclosure - revealing group-specific features only when 2+ recipients are selected.

[Source: architecture/unified-conversation-architecture.md]

#### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

- React Native 0.81.4 with TypeScript 5.9.2
- State Management: Zustand (latest)
- Image Upload: expo-image-picker + expo-image-manipulator
- Navigation: Expo Router (file-based routing)

**Backend:**

- Firebase JavaScript SDK (latest) - Firestore, Storage, Auth
- Firebase Storage for group photos
- Firestore real-time listeners for group synchronization

**Testing:**

- Jest 29.x + React Native Testing Library
- Firebase Emulator Suite
- Detox for E2E testing

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

#### Data Models

**Conversation Model (Group Fields):**

```typescript
interface Conversation {
  id: string;
  type: 'direct' | 'group'; // AC: 6 - Distinguish conversation type
  participantIds: string[]; // AC: 6 - Array of participant UIDs (3-50 for groups)
  groupName?: string; // AC: 4, 6 - Required for group chats
  groupPhotoURL?: string; // AC: 5, 6 - Optional group photo URL
  creatorId?: string; // AC: 6 - UID of group creator (for permissions)
  lastMessage: {
    text: string;
    senderId: string;
    timestamp: firebase.firestore.Timestamp;
  };
  lastMessageTimestamp: firebase.firestore.Timestamp;
  unreadCount: Record<string, number>; // Per-user unread counts (works for groups)
  archivedBy: Record<string, boolean>;
  deletedBy: Record<string, boolean>;
  mutedBy: Record<string, boolean>;
  createdAt: firebase.firestore.Timestamp;
  updatedAt: firebase.firestore.Timestamp;
}
```

**Key Points:**

- `type: 'group'` identifies group conversations (AC: 6)
- `participantIds` array supports 3-50 users for groups (AC: 2, 3)
- `groupName` is required for group chats (AC: 4, 6)
- `creatorId` tracks group creator for future permission checks (Story 4.3)
- Existing maps (`unreadCount`, `archivedBy`, etc.) are per-user and scale to groups

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Conversation]

#### Database Schema

**Firestore Collections Structure:**

```
conversations/{conversationId}
  ├── type: 'direct' | 'group'
  ├── participantIds: string[]        // array-contains query for all participants
  ├── groupName?: string
  ├── groupPhotoURL?: string
  ├── creatorId?: string
  ├── lastMessage: object
  ├── lastMessageTimestamp: timestamp
  ├── unreadCount: { [userId]: number }
  ├── archivedBy: { [userId]: boolean }
  ├── deletedBy: { [userId]: boolean }
  ├── mutedBy: { [userId]: boolean }
  ├── createdAt: timestamp
  ├── updatedAt: timestamp
  └── messages/ (subcollection)       // Same structure for groups and direct chats
```

**Firestore Indexes:**

Existing composite index already supports group conversations:

```json
{
  "collectionGroup": "conversations",
  "fields": [
    { "fieldPath": "participantIds", "arrayConfig": "CONTAINS" },
    { "fieldPath": "lastMessageTimestamp", "order": "DESCENDING" }
  ]
}
```

This index enables efficient queries like:

```typescript
where('participantIds', 'array-contains', userId).orderBy('lastMessageTimestamp', 'desc');
```

The `array-contains` query returns ALL conversations where the user is a participant, including groups with 50 members.

#### Firebase Storage Structure

**Group Photo Storage Path:**

```
gs://{bucket}/groups/{groupId}/photo.jpg
```

**Upload Process:**

1. Compress image to 512x512 using expo-image-manipulator (quality 0.7)
2. Upload compressed image to Firebase Storage
3. Generate public download URL
4. Store URL in conversation document as `groupPhotoURL`

**Security Rules:**

```javascript
// firebase/storage.rules
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Group photos
    match /groups/{groupId}/photo.jpg {
      // Only group creator can upload/update group photo
      allow write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid == firestore.get(/databases/(default)/documents/conversations/$(groupId)).data.creatorId;
      // All authenticated users can read group photos
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // User profile photos (existing rule from Epic 1)
    match /users/{userId}/profilePhoto.jpg {
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**

- Group photos are stored at `groups/{groupId}/photo.jpg`
- Only the group creator (creatorId) can upload or update the group photo
- All authenticated users can view group photos
- This extends existing storage rules for user profile photos

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#Firebase-Services-Configuration]

#### Firestore Security Rules (Group Creation)

**Conversation Creation Rules:**

```javascript
match /conversations/{conversationId} {
  allow create: if request.auth != null &&
    request.auth.uid in request.resource.data.participantIds &&
    (
      // Direct conversation validation
      (request.resource.data.type == 'direct' &&
       request.resource.data.participantIds.size() == 2) ||

      // Group conversation validation (AC: 2, 3, 6)
      (request.resource.data.type == 'group' &&
       request.resource.data.creatorId == request.auth.uid &&  // Creator must match auth
       request.resource.data.groupName != null &&              // Group name required
       request.resource.data.groupName.size() > 0 &&
       request.resource.data.participantIds.size() >= 3 &&     // Min 3 participants
       request.resource.data.participantIds.size() <= 50)      // Max 50 participants
    );
}
```

**Key Validations:**

- User must be in `participantIds` to create conversation
- For groups: `type='group'`, `creatorId` matches auth.uid, `groupName` exists
- Participant count: 3-50 for groups (AC: 2, 3)
- Group name must not be empty (AC: 4)

#### Frontend Component Patterns

**Group Creation Screen Component Structure:**

```typescript
// app/(tabs)/conversations/new.tsx (enhanced for group support)
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Button } from 'react-native';
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';
import { RecipientTokenField } from '@/components/conversation/RecipientTokenField';
import { GroupNameInput } from '@/components/conversation/GroupNameInput';
import { conversationService } from '@/services/conversationService';
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth';

export default function UnifiedConversationCreationScreen() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const [recipients, setRecipients] = useState<User[]>([]);
  const [groupName, setGroupName] = useState('');
  const [isGroupMode, setIsGroupMode] = useState(false);
  const [isCreating, setIsCreating] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const handleCreateGroup = async () => {
    // Validation: AC 2, 3, 4
    if (!groupName.trim()) {
      setError('Group name is required');
      return;
    }

    const totalParticipants = selectedUsers.length + 1; // +1 for creator
    if (totalParticipants < 3) {

      return;
    }

    if (totalParticipants > 50) {
      setError('Maximum 50 participants allowed');
      return;
    }

    setIsCreating(true);
    setError(null);

    try {
      // Upload photo if selected (AC: 5)
      let photoURL: string | undefined;
      if (groupPhotoUri) {
        photoURL = await conversationService.uploadGroupPhoto(groupPhotoUri, 'temp-id');
      }

      // Create group conversation (AC: 6)
      const participantIds = [user!.uid, ...selectedUsers];
      const conversationId = await conversationService.createGroupConversation(
        groupName,
        participantIds,
        photoURL
      );

      // Navigate to new group chat
      router.push(`/conversations/${conversationId}`);
    } catch (err) {
      setError('Failed to create group. Please try again.');
      console.error('Group creation error:', err);
    } finally {
      setIsCreating(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      {/* Group name input */}
      {/* User picker with search */}
      {/* Selected users list */}
      {/* Group photo upload button */}
      {/* Create button with loading state */}
      {/* Error message display */}
    </View>
  );

 * @param participantIds - Array of user UIDs including creator (3-50 total)
 * @param groupPhotoURL - Optional group photo URL from Firebase Storage
 * @returns Promise resolving to the created conversation ID
 * @throws {FirebaseError} When Firestore write fails or validation fails
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const conversationId = await createGroupConversation(
 *   'Team Chat',
 *   ['creatorUid', 'user2Uid', 'user3Uid'],

#### Real-Time Synchronization for Groups

**Existing Query Already Supports Groups:**

The current conversation subscription uses `array-contains` which automatically works for group conversations:

```typescript
// services/conversationService.ts - EXISTING (no changes needed)
subscribeToConversations(userId: string, callback: (conversations: Conversation[]) => void) {
  const q = query(
    collection(firestore, 'conversations'),
    where('participantIds', 'array-contains', userId),  // Works for groups!
    where(`deletedBy.${userId}`, '!=', true),
    orderBy('lastMessageTimestamp', 'desc'),
    limit(30)
  );

  return onSnapshot(q, (snapshot) => {
    const conversations = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
      id: doc.id,
      ...doc.data(),
    }) as Conversation);
    callback(conversations);
  });
}
```

**How it works for groups:**

- When group is created with `participantIds: ['user1', 'user2', 'user3']`
- Each user has an active listener with `where('participantIds', 'array-contains', userId)`
- Firestore automatically returns the new group conversation to ALL participants
- Group appears in each participant's conversation list in real-time (AC: 7, 8)

**No code changes needed** - existing infrastructure supports groups automatically.

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Service-Example, architecture/database-schema.md#Firestore-Indexes]

#### Coding Standards Reminders

**Critical Rules for Story 4.1:**

1. **Firebase Access**: Never access Firebase directly from components - use service layer
   - Components call `conversationService.createGroupConversation()`
   - Services handle Firestore and Storage operations

2. **Optimistic Updates**: Show immediate UI feedback before server confirmation
   - Add group to local conversation list immediately
   - Update after server confirms creation

3. **Error Handling**: All async operations must have try-catch with user-friendly errors
   - "Failed to create group. Please try again." (not Firebase error codes)
   - Log full error to console for debugging

4. **Type Safety**: All functions must have proper TypeScript types
   - No `any` types without explanation
   - Use `Conversation` interface from `types/models.ts`

5. **JSDoc Documentation**: All public functions must have @param, @returns, @throws, @example
   - See service layer examples above

6. **Validation**: Validate all user input before calling services
   - Group name not empty (AC: 4)
   - Participant count 3-50 (AC: 2, 3)
   - Show validation errors to user immediately

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment:**

All file paths follow existing project structure:

- Enhanced unified conversation creation screen in `app/(tabs)/conversations/new.tsx`
- Service functions in `services/conversationService.ts`
- TypeScript types in `types/models.ts`
- Tests in `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`

**No conflicts found** - group chat is a natural extension of existing conversation infrastructure.

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Dependencies on Other Stories

**Depends On (Completed):**

- ✅ **Story 1.1-1.4**: User authentication and profile management (Firebase Auth)
- ✅ **Story 2.1**: Firestore data model with Conversation type field
- ✅ **Story 2.2**: User search functionality (needed for participant selection)
- ✅ **Story 2.3**: Real-time chat infrastructure (works for groups automatically)
- ✅ **Story 3.5**: Push notifications (optional for group creation notifications)
- ✅ **Story 3.7**: Unread count infrastructure (already supports group participants)

**Informs Future Stories:**

- → **Story 4.2**: Group chat messaging (uses group conversations created here)
- → **Story 4.3**: Group participant management (uses creatorId for permissions)
- → **Story 4.4**: Group typing indicators and read receipts

[Source: Epic 4 PRD - Story dependencies]

### Implementation Approach

**Story 4.1 Implementation Strategy:**

Given that existing infrastructure (data model, real-time listeners, security rules) already supports the concept of multiple participants, Story 4.1 focuses on **building the UI and service layer** for group creation.

**Phase 1: Backend Service Layer** (Tasks 3, 4, 8, 9)

1. Implement group photo upload to Firebase Storage
2. Add `createGroupConversation()` to conversation service
3. Update TypeScript interfaces for group fields
4. Update Firestore Security Rules for group creation validation

**Phase 2: Frontend UI** (Tasks 1, 2, 5, 6, 7)

1. Add "New Group" button to conversation list
2. Create group creation screen with user picker
3. Integrate group creation flow with service layer
4. Update conversation list to display group chats
5. Update chat screen header for group display

**Phase 3: Real-Time Sync & Notifications** (Tasks 10, 11)

1. Verify real-time group subscription works for all participants
2. Implement in-app notification for group creation (optional push notification)

**Phase 4: Testing** (Tasks 12, 13, 14, 15, 16)

1. Unit tests for service layer
2. Component tests for group creation screen
3. Integration tests for full group creation flow
4. E2E tests for user journey
5. Manual QA on physical devices

**Key Decision Points:**

**Q: Should we allow group creation with only 2 participants?**
**A**: No. Per AC: 2, minimum is 3 total participants (creator + 2 others). This differentiates groups from direct chats and justifies the group creation flow.

**Q: How to handle group photo upload failure?**
**A**: Group creation should still succeed without photo. Show error message about photo upload failure, but create group with default group icon. User can update photo later (Story 4.3).

**Q: Should we send push notifications when users are added to groups?**
**A**: For MVP, in-app notification is sufficient (real-time listener shows new group). Push notification can be added via Cloud Function in future enhancement.

**Q: What happens if Firestore Security Rules reject group creation?**
**A**: Frontend validation should prevent this (participant count check). If rules reject anyway, show generic error to user and log specific error for debugging.

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Test File Locations:**

- Service tests: `tests/unit/services/conversationService.groupCreation.test.ts`
- Component tests: `tests/unit/components/UnifiedConversationCreation.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/group-creation.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/group-creation.e2e.ts`

**Testing Frameworks:**

- **Jest** 29.x - Test runner
- **React Native Testing Library** - Component testing
- **Firebase Emulator Suite** - Firestore and Storage testing (integration tests)
- **Detox** - End-to-end mobile testing

**Test Coverage Requirements:**

- All group creation service functions must have unit tests
- Group creation screen must have component tests
- Integration tests must verify E2E group creation flow (UI → Service → Firestore)
- E2E tests must validate group creation on both iOS and Android devices

**Mocking Strategy:**

- Mock Firestore SDK using Jest mocks for unit tests
- Mock Firebase Storage for unit tests
- Use Firebase Emulator for integration tests (real Firestore and Storage)
- Mock useAuth hook in component tests
- No mocks for E2E tests (use real Firebase or emulator)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-23

### Reviewer: Quinn (QA Test Architect)

### Gate Decision: **CONCERNS** 🟡

### Executive Summary

Story 4.1 implementation for group chat creation is **functionally complete** with core requirements met. The system supports 50-participant groups with photo uploads and proper security rules. However, there are **critical gaps in test coverage** that present significant quality risks.

### Requirements Traceability ✅

All 10 acceptance criteria have been implemented:

- ✅ AC1: Unified conversation creation detects group mode (2+ recipients)
- ✅ AC2: Group creation allows 2+ other users (3-50 total participants)
- ✅ AC3: Maximum 50 participants enforced with validation
- ✅ AC4: Group name required field (max 50 chars)
- ✅ AC5: Group photo upload available during creation
- ✅ AC6: Firestore document created with correct structure
- ✅ AC7: All participants receive updates via real-time listeners
- ✅ AC8: Group displays in conversation list after first message
- ✅ AC9: Group chat header shows name and photo
- ✅ AC10: TypeScript interfaces support group fields

### Implementation Quality Assessment

#### Strengths 💪

1. **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with service layer
2. **Security Rules**: Comprehensive Firestore validation (3-50 participants, group name required)
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
4. **User Experience**: Progressive disclosure UI, clear validation messages
5. **Performance**: Image compression before upload (512x512, 0.7 quality)
6. **Constants Management**: Centralized GROUP_SIZE_LIMIT with documentation

#### Critical Issues 🚨

**1. ZERO Test Coverage** (HIGH RISK)

- **No unit tests** for `uploadGroupPhoto()` function
- **No component tests** for group creation UI
- **No integration tests** for group creation flow
- **No E2E tests** for user journey
- **No validation tests** for 3-50 participant limits
- Tasks 12-16 marked incomplete in story

**2. Security Rule Gaps** (MEDIUM RISK)

- Storage rules allow ANY authenticated user to upload/delete group photos
- Should restrict to group creator/admin only
- Comment acknowledges: "In future, we'll check if user is group creator/admin"

**3. Error Handling Limitations** (LOW RISK)

- Group photo upload failures are silently swallowed
- No retry mechanism for failed uploads
- Users not informed if photo upload fails

### Risk Assessment 📊

| Risk Area          | Severity | Probability | Impact                 | Mitigation Required       |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Test Coverage      | HIGH     | Certain     | Production bugs        | Write comprehensive tests |
| Photo Permissions  | MEDIUM   | Likely      | Security vulnerability | Update storage rules      |
| Silent Failures    | LOW      | Possible    | Poor UX                | Add user notifications    |
| Participant Limits | LOW      | Unlikely    | Data corruption        | Already validated         |

### Technical Debt Identified 💳

1. **Test Debt**: ~40 hours needed for full test suite
2. **Security Debt**: Storage rules need creator validation
3. **Monitoring Debt**: No metrics for group creation success/failure
4. **Documentation Debt**: Missing API documentation for service functions

### Recommendations 📋

#### Must Fix Before Production

1. **Write Critical Tests** (P0)
   - Unit test `uploadGroupPhoto()` with mocked Storage
   - Integration test group creation with 3, 25, 50 participants
   - Test validation boundaries (2, 51 participants)
   - Test group name required validation

2. **Update Storage Rules** (P0)
   ```javascript
   // Add creator check for group photos
   allow create, update: if request.auth.uid ==
     firestore.get(/databases/(default)/documents/conversations/$(groupId)).data.creatorId;
   ```

#### Should Fix Soon

3. **Improve Error Handling** (P1)
   - Show toast when photo upload fails
   - Add retry button for failed uploads
   - Log telemetry for failure rates

4. **Add Monitoring** (P1)
   - Track group creation success rate
   - Monitor photo upload performance
   - Alert on validation failure spikes

### Test Strategy Requirements

#### Unit Tests (8 hours)

```typescript
// conversationService.groupCreation.test.ts
- Test createConversationWithFirstMessage for groups
- Test uploadGroupPhoto success/failure
- Test participant validation (min 3, max 50)
- Test group name validation
```

#### Integration Tests (8 hours)

```typescript
// group-creation.test.ts
- Test atomic creation with Firestore emulator
- Test real-time sync to all participants
- Test storage upload with emulator

```

#### E2E Tests (4 hours)

```typescript
// group-creation.e2e.ts
- Test complete user flow on iOS/Android
- Test photo selection and upload
- Test participant selection limits
- Test navigation after creation
```
