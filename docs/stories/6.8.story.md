# Story 6.8: Migrate Edge Functions to Cloud Functions

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** development team,
**I want** to migrate AI processing logic from Vercel Edge Functions to Firebase Cloud Functions,
**so that** we eliminate HTTP overhead, improve workflow performance by 5-13 seconds per execution, and simplify our infrastructure stack.

## Context

Currently, the daily agent workflow makes HTTP calls from Cloud Functions to Vercel Edge Functions for AI processing (categorization, sentiment analysis, opportunity scoring). This introduces 100-300ms network latency per request, which compounds significantly during batch processing of 100 messages.

**Current Architecture:**
```
Cloud Function → HTTP → Vercel Edge Function → OpenAI API
                 ↓
            100-300ms network latency per request
```

**Target Architecture:**
```
Cloud Function → OpenAI API (direct)
       ↓
  No HTTP overhead
```

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Migration Completeness:**
   - AC1: New `functions/src/ai/categorization.ts` created with identical functionality to `api/categorize-message.ts`
   - AC2: Categorization logic uses official OpenAI SDK instead of Vercel AI SDK
   - AC3: `daily-agent-workflow.ts` updated to call local functions instead of HTTP fetch
   - AC4: All prompts and response formats remain identical (byte-for-byte output parity)

2. **Performance:**
   - AC5: Workflow execution time reduces by 5-13 seconds (100 message batch)
   - AC6: Categorization completes in <500ms (same as Edge Function baseline)
   - AC7: No increase in Cloud Function memory usage (stays within 512MB limit)

3. **Testing & Validation:**
   - AC8: Unit tests prove categorization output parity (old vs new)
   - AC9: Unit tests prove sentiment analysis output parity
   - AC10: Unit tests prove opportunity scoring output parity
   - AC11: Integration test validates full workflow with direct calls
   - AC12: All existing tests continue to pass

4. **Deployment & Verification:**
   - AC13: Production deployment successful with no errors
   - AC14: Performance monitoring shows 5-13 second improvement in production
   - AC15: No increase in error rates or memory usage in production

5. **Complete Cleanup:**
   - AC16: All Edge Function files deleted (`api/categorize-message.ts`, `api/utils/aiClient.ts`)
   - AC17: Vercel AI SDK dependencies removed from `package.json`
   - AC18: Environment variables cleaned up (remove Vercel-specific vars)
   - AC19: Deployment documentation updated with new architecture
   - AC20: No dead code or deprecated code remains in codebase

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

From Story 6.7 (Epic 5 Code Cleanup):
- Successfully removed deprecated Epic 5 approval mode code (~534 lines)
- Codebase is clean and ready for infrastructure improvements
- Test suite is healthy (200+ tests passing)
- Daily agent workflow is stable and running in production

### Current Edge Function Implementation

**File:** `api/categorize-message.ts` (382 lines)
- Uses Vercel Edge Runtime (`runtime: 'edge'`)
- Uses Vercel AI SDK (`@ai-sdk/openai`, `ai` package)
- Handles: categorization + sentiment analysis + opportunity scoring
- **Note:** FAQ detection was rolled into categorization logic (no separate endpoint needed)
- Model: GPT-4o-mini for categorization, GPT-4 Turbo for opportunity scoring
- Response time: <500ms average
- Called via HTTP from `daily-agent-workflow.ts`

**File:** `api/utils/aiClient.ts` (514 lines)
- Contains core AI logic: `categorizeMessage()`, `scoreOpportunity()`
- Uses `generateText()` from Vercel AI SDK
- Prompt templates: CATEGORIZATION_SENTIMENT_PROMPT, OPPORTUNITY_SCORING_PROMPT
- Retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- Crisis detection: sentimentScore < -0.7
- Opportunity fallback: Rule-based scoring if AI fails

**Files to Delete After Migration:**
- `api/categorize-message.ts` (Edge Function handler)
- `api/utils/aiClient.ts` (Vercel AI SDK wrapper)
- `api/utils/rateLimiter.ts` (if no longer used elsewhere)

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/ai-integration/ai-data-models.md]

**AI Message Metadata:**
```typescript
interface MessageMetadata {
  aiProcessed: boolean;
  category?: 'fan_engagement' | 'business_opportunity' | 'spam' | 'urgent' | 'general';
  confidence?: number;
  sentiment?: 'positive' | 'negative' | 'neutral' | 'mixed';
  sentimentScore?: number; // -1 to 1 scale
  emotionalTone?: string[];
  crisisDetected?: boolean;
  opportunityScore?: number; // 0-100
  opportunityType?: 'sponsorship' | 'collaboration' | 'partnership' | 'sale';
}
```

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/ai-integration/ai-api-integration.md]

**Current (Edge Function):**
```
POST https://api.yipyap.wtf/api/categorize-message
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Body: { messageId, messageText, conversationId, senderId }
Response: { category, confidence, sentiment, sentimentScore, ... }
```

**Target (Local Function):**
```typescript
import { categorizeMessage } from './ai/categorization';
const result = await categorizeMessage(messageText, apiKey);
// Returns: { category, confidence, sentiment, sentimentScore, ... }
```

### Tech Stack Changes

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Replace:**
- ❌ Vercel AI SDK (`@ai-sdk/openai`, `ai`) - Edge Function dependency
- ❌ Vercel Edge Functions - HTTP overhead

**With:**
- ✅ Official OpenAI SDK (`openai`) - Direct API client
- ✅ Firebase Cloud Functions Gen2 - No HTTP overhead

**Keep:**
- ✅ OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for categorization ($0.15/$0.60 per 1M tokens)
- ✅ OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo for opportunity scoring ($10/$30 per 1M tokens)
- ✅ All prompts, logic, and response formats unchanged

### File Locations

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md, architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**New Files to Create:**
```
functions/src/ai/categorization.ts          # Categorization + sentiment analysis
functions/src/ai/opportunity-scoring.ts     # Opportunity scoring logic
```

**Files to Modify:**
```
functions/src/ai/daily-agent-workflow.ts    # Remove HTTP calls, add direct imports
functions/src/index.ts                      # Export V4 workflow function
```

**Files to Deprecate (keep for 30 days):**
```
api/categorize-message.ts                   # Edge Function handler
api/utils/aiClient.ts                       # Vercel AI SDK wrapper
```

### SDK Migration Details

**Vercel AI SDK → OpenAI SDK:**

```typescript
// OLD (Vercel AI SDK)
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
  prompt: categoryPrompt,
  temperature: 0.3,
});

// NEW (OpenAI SDK)
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: categoryPrompt }],
  temperature: 0.3,
});
const text = completion.choices[0].message.content;
```

### Performance Targets

[Source: architecture/ai-integration/ai-performance.md, docs/tasks/edge-function-migration.md]

**Current Performance (with HTTP overhead):**
- Daily agent workflow: 15-25 seconds for 100 messages
- Per-message overhead: 100-300ms network latency
- Total HTTP overhead: 10-30 seconds per workflow

**Target Performance (direct calls):**
- Daily agent workflow: 10-15 seconds for 100 messages (5-13 second improvement)
- Per-message overhead: 0ms (no network calls)
- Categorization latency: <500ms (same as Edge Function)

**Memory:**
- Cloud Function limit: 512MB
- Expected usage: 256MB (no increase expected)

### Error Handling Strategy

[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

**Preserve existing patterns:**
- Retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (100ms → 200ms → 400ms)
- Confidence threshold: <0.7 defaults to "general" category
- Crisis detection: sentimentScore < -0.7 triggers urgent flag
- Opportunity fallback: Rule-based scoring if AI fails
- Graceful degradation: Never fail workflow due to categorization errors

### Authentication & Security

[Source: architecture/ai-integration/ai-performance.md]

**Authentication Guards (CRITICAL):**
- Edge Functions use Bearer token authentication
- Cloud Functions run in server context (no user authentication needed)
- Remove HTTP authentication logic (extractUserId, Authorization header)
- OPENAI_API_KEY must be set in Firebase Functions environment
- Rate limiting handled by Firebase (not Upstash Redis)

### Integration Patterns

[Source: architecture/ai-integration/ai-performance.md]

**Performance Tracking:**
```typescript
import { trackOperationStart, trackOperationEnd } from './aiPerformanceService';

const operationId = `categorization_${messageId}_${Date.now()}`;
trackOperationStart(operationId, 'categorization');

try {
  const result = await categorizeMessage(messageText, apiKey);

  await trackOperationEnd(operationId, {
    userId: recipientId,
    operation: 'categorization',
    success: true,
    modelUsed: 'gpt-4o-mini',
    tokensUsed: { prompt: 150, completion: 50, total: 200 },
    costCents: 0.05,
    cacheHit: false,
  });

  return result;
} catch (error) {
  await trackOperationEnd(operationId, {
    userId: recipientId,
    operation: 'categorization',
    success: false,
    errorType: 'model_error',
  });
  throw error;
}
```

### Risks & Mitigation

[Source: docs/tasks/edge-function-migration.md]

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Behavioral differences in AI responses | Side-by-side comparison testing with parity tests (AC8-AC10) |
| OpenAI SDK differences from Vercel SDK | Review SDK docs, test all features, preserve exact prompts |
| Increased Cloud Function memory usage | Monitor memory during testing, adjust if needed (unlikely) |
| Breaking existing workflows | Comprehensive testing (unit + integration) before deployment |
| Performance regression | Performance validation required before deployment (AC14) |

**Migration Strategy:**
- Test thoroughly in development environment
- Run parity tests to ensure identical output
- Deploy directly to production after validation
- Monitor closely for first 24 hours post-deployment
- Complete cleanup only after production validation

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Locations:**
```
functions/tests/unit/ai/categorization.test.ts           # Unit tests for categorization parity
functions/tests/unit/ai/opportunity-scoring.test.ts      # Unit tests for opportunity scoring
functions/tests/integration/daily-agent-workflow-migration.test.ts  # Integration test
```

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests must prove byte-for-byte output parity (old vs new)
- Test with real message examples (not synthetic data)
- Test edge cases: empty messages, very long messages, special characters
- Test all sentiment ranges: positive, negative, neutral, mixed, crisis
- Test all categories: fan_engagement, business_opportunity, spam, urgent, general
- Integration test must validate 5-13 second speedup
- All existing tests must continue passing (200+ tests)

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Jest for unit tests
- Firebase Emulator Suite for integration tests
- Manual testing with real user data in staging

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**
- Never access Firebase directly - use service layer
- All async operations must have try-catch with user-friendly errors
- All public functions must have JSDoc documentation
- Type safety: Use TypeScript types from `/types` directory
- Error handling: Preserve retry logic and fallback patterns
- Performance: Track all AI operations with aiPerformanceService

**JSDoc Template:**
```typescript
/**
 * Categorize a message and analyze sentiment using GPT-4o-mini
 *
 * @param messageText - The message text to analyze
 * @param apiKey - OpenAI API key
 * @returns Promise resolving to categorization and sentiment result
 * @throws {Error} When all retry attempts fail or response is invalid
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const result = await categorizeMessage('Love your content!', apiKey);
 * console.log(result.category); // 'fan_engagement'
 * console.log(result.sentiment); // 'positive'
 * ```
 */
export async function categorizeMessage(
  messageText: string,
  apiKey: string
): Promise<CategorizationResult> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Dependencies

[Source: functions/package.json analysis needed]

**Add to `functions/package.json`:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "openai": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Remove after migration (30-day window):**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@ai-sdk/openai": "...",
    "ai": "..."
  }
}
```

### Expected Impact

[Source: docs/tasks/edge-function-migration.md]

**Performance:**
- Save 5-13 seconds per workflow execution (100 messages)
- Reduce points of failure (no HTTP dependency)
- Simpler stack traces for debugging

**Cost:**
- Slightly lower (fewer network hops)
- Same OpenAI API costs

**Reliability:**
- No Vercel Edge Function downtime risk
- No HTTP timeout errors
- Unified logging in Firebase

**Developer Experience:**
- Simpler codebase (one less service to maintain)
- Faster local development (no HTTP mocking needed)
- Easier debugging (single stack trace)

**Codebase Cleanliness:**
- Remove ~900 lines of Edge Function code
- Remove 2 npm dependencies (`@ai-sdk/openai`, `ai`)
- Eliminate entire `/api` directory
- Single AI processing stack (Firebase Cloud Functions only)
