# Story 1.1: Project Foundation & Infrastructure Setup

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** the React Native/Expo project scaffolded with TypeScript, Firebase, and CI/CD configured,
**so that** I have a solid foundation to build features on with quality tooling in place.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React Native project initialized with Expo managed workflow (latest stable version)
2. TypeScript configured with strict mode enabled and proper tsconfig.json settings
3. Firebase project created with development and production environments
4. Firebase SDK integrated (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Messaging) with environment-based configuration
5. Git repository initialized with .gitignore configured for React Native/Expo
6. ESLint and Prettier configured with TypeScript + React Native rules
7. Basic app structure created with navigation placeholder (React Navigation installed)
8. CI/CD pipeline configured (GitHub Actions or EAS Build) for automated builds
9. App displays a simple "Welcome to yipyap" canary screen on launch (proof of working app)
10. Project documentation includes setup instructions and architecture overview

## Dev Notes

### Firebase Configuration Approach

- Using Firebase JavaScript SDK (not React Native Firebase)
- Configuration via API keys in environment variables
- No native configuration files (`GoogleService-Info.plist` or `google-services.json`) needed
- Compatible with Expo Go for development
- Push notifications (Epic 3) will require Expo Development Build for Android only

### Technology Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **React Native:** v0.81.4 (latest stable)
- **TypeScript:** v5.9.2 with strict mode
- **Expo CLI:** v54.0.13 (managed workflow)
- **Firebase SDK:** latest version
- **State Management:** Zustand (latest)
- **UI Components:** React Native Elements (latest)
- **Testing:** Jest 29.x + React Native Testing Library
- **CI/CD:** Expo EAS Build (latest)

```

### Environment Configuration

[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#required-environment-variables]
Required environment variables for `.env.local`:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### Firebase Initialization

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#firebase-services-configuration]

- Firebase services must be initialized in `/services/firebase.ts`
- Use environment-based configuration for dev/staging/prod
- Never access Firebase directly from components - use service layer

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

- All async operations must have try-catch with user-friendly error messages
- Access environment variables only through Config object
- Never access Firebase directly from components
- All public APIs must be documented with JSDoc/TSDoc comments

### CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#cicd-pipeline]

- Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and linting
- Configure EAS Build for cloud builds
- Set up automated deployment to stores for production branch
- Required GitHub secret: EXPO_TOKEN

### Initial Security Rules

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#firestore-security-rules]

- Deploy basic security rules that deny all access initially
- Rules will be updated in Story 1.5 for proper user authentication
- Storage rules should initially deny all access

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Test file location:** `/tests/unit/` for unit tests
- **Testing framework:** Jest 29.x with React Native Testing Library
- **Test organization:** Separate directories for unit, integration, and e2e tests
- **Required for this story:**
  - Basic App component test to verify render
  - Test that welcome screen displays correctly
  - Verify Firebase initialization doesn't throw errors
  - All tests must pass before marking story complete
