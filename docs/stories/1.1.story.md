## Dev Notes

### Firebase Configuration Approach

- Using Firebase JavaScript SDK (not React Native Firebase)
- Configuration via API keys in environment variables
- No native configuration files (`GoogleService-Info.plist` or `google-services.json`) needed
- Compatible with Expo Go for development
- Push notifications (Epic 3) will require Expo Development Build for Android only

- **TypeScript:** v5.9.2 with strict mode
- **Expo CLI:** v54.0.13 (managed workflow)
- **Firebase SDK:** latest version
- **State Management:** Zustand (latest)
- **UI Components:** React Native Elements (latest)

EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### Firebase Initialization

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#firebase-services-configuration]

- Firebase services must be initialized in `/services/firebase.ts`
- Use environment-based configuration for dev/staging/prod
- Never access Firebase directly from components - use service layer

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

- All async operations must have try-catch with user-friendly error messages
- Access environment variables only through Config object
- Never access Firebase directly from components
- All public APIs must be documented with JSDoc/TSDoc comments

### CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#cicd-pipeline]

- Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and linting
- Configure EAS Build for cloud builds
- Set up automated deployment to stores for production branch
- Required GitHub secret: EXPO_TOKEN

### Initial Security Rules

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#firestore-security-rules]

- Deploy basic security rules that deny all access initially
- Rules will be updated in Story 1.5 for proper user authentication
- Storage rules should initially deny all access

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Test file location:** `/tests/unit/` for unit tests
- **Testing framework:** Jest 29.x with React Native Testing Library
- **Test organization:** Separate directories for unit, integration, and e2e tests
- **Required for this story:**
  - Basic App component test to verify render
  - Test that welcome screen displays correctly
  - Verify Firebase initialization doesn't throw errors
  - All tests must pass before marking story complete

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall: Strong foundation with excellent architecture and documentation**

The implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with proper TypeScript strict mode, comprehensive TSDoc documentation, clean separation of concerns, and adherence to coding standards. The Firebase service layer is well-designed with proper error handling and abstraction. Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, Husky) are properly configured and the CI/CD pipeline is production-ready.

The project structure follows the defined architecture, with clear organization and proper use of path aliases. Environment variable management through the centralized Config object is exemplary and follows best practices.

**Key Strengths:**

- ✅ Excellent TSDoc documentation on all public APIs
- ✅ Proper service layer abstraction for Firebase
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled and configured correctly
- ✅ Comprehensive README with clear setup instructions
- ✅ Security rules properly deny all by default
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline well-configured with multiple quality gates

**Areas for Improvement:**

- ⚠️ Test coverage is minimal and lacks behavioral/integration tests
- ⚠️ Only structural tests exist (checking exports), no scenario coverage
- ⚠️ Missing integration tests as required by Story AC #10 and testing-strategy.md

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
  - **Change**: Escaped apostrophe in React text component (line 25)
  - **Why**: ESLint error `react/no-unescaped-entities` was blocking the lint check
  - **How**: Changed `You're` to `You&apos;re` to properly escape the apostrophe in JSX

- **File**: `jest.config.js`
  - **Change**: Migrated ts-jest configuration from deprecated `globals` to modern `transform` syntax
  - **Why**: ts-jest was emitting deprecation warnings about the old globals configuration format
  - **How**: Moved ts-jest config from `globals['ts-jest']` to `transform['^.+\\.tsx?$']` array syntax per ts-jest best practices

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent compliance
  - All public APIs documented with TSDoc
  - Firebase access through service layer only
  - Environment variables accessed only through Config
  - Try-catch blocks on async operations
  - Proper naming conventions followed

- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect adherence
  - Directory structure matches unified-project-structure.md
  - Proper separation of app/, services/, constants/
  - Path aliases configured as specified

- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ Partially compliant
  - Test organization follows testing-strategy.md structure
  - Jest and React Native Testing Library configured correctly
  - **GAP**: Missing integration tests required by strategy
  - **GAP**: Only structural tests, no behavioral unit tests
  - Coverage thresholds defined (50%) but not meaningful without proper tests

- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 10 acceptance criteria technically satisfied
  - AC #1-9: Fully implemented and verified
  - AC #10: Documentation exists but test quality could be improved

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed During Review:**

- [x] Fixed ESLint error for unescaped apostrophe (app/(tabs)/index.tsx)
- [x] Updated Jest configuration to use modern ts-jest syntax (jest.config.js)
- [x] Verified all tests pass (4 tests passing)
- [x] Verified type checking passes with strict mode
- [x] Verified CI/CD workflows are properly configured

**Recommended for Developer:**

- [ ] Add behavioral unit tests for Firebase service initialization and error scenarios
- [ ] Add unit tests for Config module edge cases (missing env vars, invalid values)
- [ ] Add integration test for app initialization flow (useEffect → initializeFirebase → success/failure paths)
- [ ] Update File List to include app/(tabs)/ directory and files
- [ ] Consider mocking Firebase in tests to avoid requiring real credentials
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting to CI pipeline (npm run test:coverage)

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** ✓

- Firebase security rules properly deny all access by default
- Service layer correctly abstracts Firebase access from components
- Environment variables properly centralized and never accessed directly
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets in code
- Config object uses proper TypeScript typing with const assertion
- .gitignore properly configured to exclude .env.local

**No security concerns identified for this foundation story.**

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS** ✓

- Firebase initialization properly deferred to useEffect (not blocking render)
- Lazy initialization pattern used correctly
- No performance concerns for infrastructure setup
- Service layer uses singleton pattern for Firebase instances

**No performance issues identified.**

### Files Modified During Review

**Modified by QA:**

- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Fixed ESLint error (unescaped apostrophe)
- `jest.config.js` - Updated to modern ts-jest configuration syntax

**Note to Dev:** Please update the File List section to include:

- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-foundation-infrastructure-setup.yml

**Quality Score: 80/100**

**Summary:** Solid foundation with excellent architecture and code quality, but test coverage needs improvement. Foundation is production-ready from an infrastructure perspective, but testing needs to be strengthened before building critical features on top.

**Issues:**

- Medium severity: Minimal test coverage lacking behavioral tests
- Medium severity: Missing integration tests required by story and testing strategy
- Low severity: File List incomplete (missing tabs directory)

**Expiration:** 2025-11-04 (2 weeks)

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above**

While all acceptance criteria are technically met and the code quality is excellent, the test coverage does not align with the project's testing strategy. The existing tests only verify structural aspects (exports exist) rather than behavioral correctness or integration scenarios.

**Recommended actions before marking Done:**

1. Add behavioral unit tests for Firebase service error handling
2. Add integration test for app initialization flow
3. Update File List to include all created files

**Note:** Story owner may choose to accept current state and address testing in a follow-up story, but the test debt should be acknowledged and tracked.
