## Dev Notes

### Technical Debt Context

**Origin:** Emergency hotfix implementation on 2025-01-21
**Issue:** Using Firestore with 30-second heartbeat instead of Realtime Database
**Impact:** Online/offline status has up to 30-second delay
**Priority:** MEDIUM - User experience issue affecting real-time feel

### Architectural Pattern: Read-Aggregate-Write for Multi-Device Presence

**CRITICAL:** When aggregating presence from multiple device sources, follow the Read-Aggregate-Write pattern to prevent data loss.

**Reference:** [docs/architecture/real-time-data-patterns.md](../architecture/real-time-data-patterns.md#pattern-2-aggregate-data-race-conditions)

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. **READ** all current device data from Realtime Database
2. **AGGREGATE** to compute overall presence status (any device online = user online)
3. **WRITE** aggregated result (preserving device data)

**Anti-pattern (DO NOT DO):**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Overwrites all device data
await update(userPresenceRef, {
  devices: {} // This destroys all device-specific presence data!
});
```

**Correct pattern:**
```typescript
// ✓ GOOD: Read first, then aggregate
const devicesRef = ref(rtdb, `presence/${userId}/devices`);
const snapshot = await get(devicesRef);
const devices = snapshot.val() || {};

// Aggregate: if ANY device is online, user is online
const isOnline = Object.values(devices).some(d => d.state === 'online');

// Update only state and lastSeen (preserve devices)
await update(userPresenceRef, {
  state: isOnline ? 'online' : 'offline',
  lastSeen: isOnline ? null : rtdbServerTimestamp()
  // ✓ Device data automatically preserved
});
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents race conditions where device data is overwritten
- Ensures correct multi-device aggregation (AC8 requirement)
- Follows defensive programming principles
- Makes data dependencies explicit

### Implementation Details

**Realtime Database Structure:**
```json
{
  "presence": {
    "userId1": {
      "state": "online",
      "lastSeen": 1706234567890,
      "devices": {
        "deviceId1": {
          "state": "online",
          "platform": "ios",
          "lastActivity": 1706234567890
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "typing": {
    "conversationId1": {
      "userId1": {
        "isTyping": true,
        "timestamp": 1706234567890
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Presence State Management:**
```typescript
interface PresenceData {
  state: 'online' | 'offline' | 'away';
  lastSeen: number; // Unix timestamp
  devices: Record<string, DevicePresence>;
}

interface DevicePresence {
  state: 'online' | 'offline';
  platform: 'ios' | 'android' | 'web';
  lastActivity: number;
  appVersion?: string;
}
```

**onDisconnect Pattern:**
```typescript
const userPresenceRef = ref(database, `presence/${userId}/devices/${deviceId}`);

// Set online
await set(userPresenceRef, {
  state: 'online',
  platform: Platform.OS,
  lastActivity: serverTimestamp()
});

// Set offline on disconnect
await onDisconnect(userPresenceRef).set({
  state: 'offline',
  lastActivity: serverTimestamp()
});
```

### Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1:** Deploy Realtime Database alongside Firestore
2. **Phase 2:** Update clients to write to both systems
3. **Phase 3:** Switch reads to Realtime Database
4. **Phase 4:** Stop writing to Firestore presence
5. **Phase 5:** Clean up old Firestore presence data

### Performance Improvements

**Current (Firestore):**
- 30-second heartbeat interval
- ~30-second delay for status changes
- High write costs for heartbeats
- 1 write every 30 seconds per user

**New (Realtime Database):**
- Instant status updates (<2 seconds)
- No heartbeat needed
- Lower costs (connection-based)
- Writes only on state change

### Dependencies on Other Stories

- **Story 2.6:** Offline support - original presence implementation
- **Story 2.3:** Chat view - typing indicators integration
- **Story 2.2:** Conversation list - presence display

### Security Considerations

**Realtime Database Rules:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "presence": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    },
    "typing": {
      "$conversationId": {
        "$uid": {
          ".read": "auth != null",
          ".write": "$uid === auth.uid",
          ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['isTyping', 'timestamp'])"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing Requirements

- Test with network throttling (slow 3G)
- Simulate frequent disconnections
- Test with 100+ concurrent users
- Verify onDisconnect cleanup
- Test multi-device scenarios
- Measure actual status update latency

### Monitoring & Metrics

- Track average presence update latency
- Monitor Realtime Database connections
- Alert on high disconnection rates
- Track database bandwidth usage
- Monitor stale device cleanup
- Log migration progress and issues

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise post-deployment:
1. Feature flag to revert to Firestore presence
2. Keep Firestore presence for 30 days
3. Dual-write period for safety
4. Monitor both systems during transition
5. One-click rollback via feature flag

### Future Enhancements

- Custom status messages
- Presence in specific channels/groups
- Scheduled status (OOO, meetings)
- Presence history/analytics
- Team presence dashboard
- Integration with calendar for auto-away

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: GOOD with CRITICAL BUG**

The implementation demonstrates excellent architectural decisions, comprehensive documentation, and thoughtful design patterns. The migration from Firestore to RTDB is well-executed with proper abstractions and clean separation of concerns. However, a critical bug in the multi-device aggregation logic prevents AC8 from being fully met.

**Strengths:**
- Exceptional JSDoc documentation throughout all services and components
- Strong TypeScript typing with well-defined interfaces
- Clean service layer architecture with singleton pattern
- Proper React hooks patterns (useConnectionState, usePresence, useTypingIndicator)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
- Good error handling with try-catch blocks
- Debouncing and performance optimizations implemented
- Security rules properly defined and validated

**Critical Issues:**
1. **CRITICAL BUG** - `presenceService.ts:149-168` - `updateAggregatedPresence()` function has fundamental design flaw
2. User preferences defined but not integrated into presence logic
3. Missing `idleDetector.ts` utility (mentioned in story but embedded in presenceService instead)

### Refactoring Performed

None - The critical bug requires architectural decision on aggregation strategy before safe refactoring can proceed.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent - JSDoc, TypeScript, naming conventions all followed
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files organized correctly in services/, hooks/, components/, utils/
- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠️ Tests exist but validate buggy implementation
- **All ACs Met**: ✗ AC8 (multi-device aggregation) is broken

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

#### 1. CRITICAL: Multi-Device Aggregation Bug (AC8 Failure)

**Location**: `services/presenceService.ts:149-168`

**Architectural Context**: This bug violates the "Read-Aggregate-Write" pattern documented in [docs/architecture/real-time-data-patterns.md](../architecture/real-time-data-patterns.md). See Dev Notes → "Architectural Pattern: Read-Aggregate-Write for Multi-Device Presence" for the correct implementation.

**Problem**: The `updateAggregatedPresence()` function has two critical flaws:

```typescript
// CURRENT BUGGY CODE (lines 155-165):
const userPresence: Pick<PresenceData, 'state' | 'lastSeen'> = {
  state: this.currentState,  // ❌ Uses only current device state
  lastSeen: rtdbServerTimestamp() as unknown as number,
};

await set(this.userPresenceRef, {
  ...userPresence,
  devices: {},  // ❌ CRITICAL: Overwrites all device data!
});
```

**Flaw #1**: Setting `devices: {}` overwrites all device-specific presence data every time this function runs. This completely destroys multi-device support.

**Flaw #2**: Uses `this.currentState` instead of reading and aggregating all device states. Per AC8 requirement: "any device online = user online".

**Impact**:
- Multi-device tracking is non-functional
- User appears offline even when other devices are online
- Device data is constantly being erased
- Violates AC8: "Support for multiple devices per user (any online = online)"

**Recommended Fix**:
```typescript
private async updateAggregatedPresence(): Promise<void> {
  if (!this.userPresenceRef) return;

  try {
    // Read all device states
    const devicesRef = ref(getFirebaseRealtimeDb(), `presence/${this.userId}/devices`);
    const snapshot = await get(devicesRef);
    const devices = snapshot.val() as Record<string, DevicePresence> || {};

    // Aggregate: if ANY device is online, user is online
    let aggregatedState: 'online' | 'offline' | 'away' = 'offline';
    let mostRecentActivity = 0;

    Object.values(devices).forEach(device => {
      if (device.state === 'online') {
        aggregatedState = this.currentState === 'away' ? 'away' : 'online';
      }
      mostRecentActivity = Math.max(mostRecentActivity, device.lastActivity);
    });

    // Update only state and lastSeen at user level (DON'T touch devices)
    await update(this.userPresenceRef, {
      state: aggregatedState,
      lastSeen: mostRecentActivity || rtdbServerTimestamp(),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to update aggregated presence:', error);
  }
}
```

**Testing Required After Fix**:
- Multi-device scenarios with 2+ devices
- Verify one device online = user online
- Verify all devices offline = user offline
- Verify device data persists across updates

#### 2. HIGH: User Preferences Not Integrated

**Location**: `services/presenceService.ts` (entire service)

**Problem**: `PresencePreferences` interface is defined in `types/user.ts` but never used:
- `invisibleMode` - should prevent presence updates
- `showOnlineStatus` - should hide status from others
- `showLastSeen` - should hide last seen timestamp
- `awayTimeoutMinutes` - hardcoded to 5 minutes instead of user preference

**Impact**: AC mentions privacy settings but they're not functional

**Recommendation**:
- Add user preferences parameter to `initialize()`
- Check `invisibleMode` before writing presence
- Respect `showOnlineStatus` and `showLastSeen` in database writes
- Use `awayTimeoutMinutes` for AWAY_TIMEOUT_MS calculation

#### 3. MEDIUM: Missing idleDetector.ts Utility

**Location**: Story mentions `utils/idleDetector.ts` but it doesn't exist

**Problem**: Away detection logic is embedded in presenceService.ts instead of separate utility

**Impact**:
- Reduced code reusability
- Harder to test idle detection in isolation
- Story file list is inaccurate

**Recommendation**: Extract away detection to separate utility or update story documentation

#### 4. MEDIUM: Type Safety Issue with serverTimestamp

**Location**: Multiple locations using `rtdbServerTimestamp() as unknown as number`

**Problem**: Type casting serverTimestamp breaks type safety

**Recommendation**:
- Use Firebase's `ServerValue.TIMESTAMP` constant
- Update `PresenceData` to allow `ServerValue` type: `lastSeen: number | object`
- Handle sentinel values properly in reads

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Coverage**: 8/10
- ✅ Unit tests for presenceService - comprehensive
- ✅ Unit tests for useConnectionState hook
- ✅ Integration tests for presence system
- ✅ Typing indicators tested
- ❌ Tests validate buggy aggregation implementation
- ❌ No UI integration tests (PresenceIndicator in actual screens)
- ❌ No performance tests (2-second latency requirement)
- ❌ No tests with actual Firebase Emulator

**Test Quality**:
- Good mocking strategy
- Clear test descriptions
- Proper async handling
- Some setTimeout usage could be flaky

**Testability**:
- **Controllability**: ✓ Good - public methods well-defined
- **Observability**: ✓ Good - callbacks for state changes
- **Debuggability**: ⚠️ Medium - silent failures hide errors

### Security Review

**Database Rules**: ✓ PASS
- Well-defined security rules in `database.rules.json`
- Users can only write own presence (`$uid === auth.uid`)
- All auth users can read presence
- Good validation rules for data structure

**Concerns**:
- ⚠️ No rate limiting - user could spam presence updates
- ⚠️ No device count limit - user could create unlimited devices
- ⚠️ No index definitions for query optimization

### Performance Considerations

- **All ACs Met**: ⚠️ AC8 now implemented correctly, but test failures need resolution

### Test Failures Requiring Attention

#### Unit Test Failure
**Location**: `tests/unit/services/presenceService.test.ts:349`
**Issue**: Test expects `platform: 'ios'` but receives `platform: undefined`
**Root Cause**: `getPlatform()` mock not properly configured in test setup
**Fix**: Update test mock for Platform.OS or mock getPlatform() directly

#### Integration Test Failures (4 tests)
**Location**: `tests/integration/presence-system.test.ts`
**Tests Failing**:
1. Multi-device aggregation edge cases
2. Typing indicator cleanup
3. Network reconnection scenarios
4. Away detection timing

**Likely Cause**: Test mocks may not reflect the updated aggregation logic

### Critical Bug Resolution Verification

**Previous Bug** (from 2025-10-22 review):
```typescript
// ❌ BUGGY CODE (old):
await set(this.userPresenceRef, {
  ...userPresence,
  devices: {},  // Destroyed all device data!
});
```

**Current Fix** (verified 2025-10-22):
```typescript
// ✅ FIXED CODE (current):
await update(this.userPresenceRef, {
  state: aggregatedState,
  lastSeen: mostRecentActivity || rtdbServerTimestamp(),
  // Device data preserved - no longer overwritten!
});
```

**Verification**: ✅ Confirmed fixed at services/presenceService.ts:177-179

### Requirements Traceability Update

**AC8: Multi-device support** - ⚠️ PARTIAL → IMPLEMENTED (tests failing)
- Implementation: ✅ NOW CORRECT - Aggregation logic fixed
- Tests: ❌ 4 integration tests failing
- Evidence: Lines 154-180 properly implement Read-Aggregate-Write pattern

All other ACs remain as previously assessed (9/10 fully passing).

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical (Must Fix Before Production)**:
- [x] Fix `updateAggregatedPresence()` aggregation bug ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Fix 5 failing tests (1 unit + 4 integration)
- [ ] Fix linting error in migratePresence.ts (FirebaseFirestore not defined)

**High Priority (Should Address Soon)**:
- [ ] Integrate user preferences (invisibleMode, showOnlineStatus, showLastSeen)
- [ ] Use user's awayTimeoutMinutes preference instead of hardcoded 5 minutes
- [ ] Add performance monitoring/metrics as mentioned in story

**Medium Priority (Consider for Follow-up)**:
- [ ] Extract away detection to separate `utils/idleDetector.ts`
- [ ] Fix serverTimestamp type casting issues
- [ ] Add device count limits to prevent abuse

### Security Review

No changes from previous review - security remains PASS.

### Performance Considerations

With the aggregation bug fixed, performance should now be optimal:
- ✅ No more unnecessary device data overwrites
- ✅ Efficient aggregation with single read operation
- ✅ Proper use of `update()` reduces bandwidth

### NFR Validation

**Security**: ✓ PASS (unchanged)
**Performance**: ✓ PASS (improved with bug fix)
**Reliability**: ⚠️ CONCERNS (test failures indicate potential edge case issues)
**Maintainability**: ✓ PASS (excellent code quality)

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → `docs/qa/gates/2.12-presence-system-upgrade.yml`

**Reason**: Critical bug fixed but test failures must be resolved before production deployment.

**Quality Score**: 75/100

### Refactoring Performed

None - Development team successfully resolved all issues identified in previous reviews. No additional refactoring needed.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ EXCELLENT - JSDoc, TypeScript, naming conventions all followed
- **Project Structure**: ✅ EXCELLENT - Files organized correctly (services/, hooks/, components/, utils/)
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ EXCELLENT - 55/55 tests passing, comprehensive unit + integration coverage
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ COMPLETE - All 10 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Issue Resolution Verification

#### ✅ RESOLVED: Multi-Device Aggregation Bug (AC8)

**Previous Issue** (First Review): Critical bug in `updateAggregatedPresence()` function was overwriting device data and not properly aggregating states.

**Fix Verified** (presenceService.ts:154-185):
```typescript
// ✅ NOW CORRECT - Implements Read-Aggregate-Write pattern
private async updateAggregatedPresence(): Promise<void> {
  // 1. READ all device data first
  const devicesRef = ref(getFirebaseRealtimeDb(), `presence/${this.userId}/devices`);
  const snapshot = await get(devicesRef);
  const devices = snapshot.val() as Record<string, DevicePresence> || {};

  // 2. AGGREGATE: if ANY device is online, user is online
  let aggregatedState: 'online' | 'offline' | 'away' = 'offline';
  Object.values(devices).forEach(device => {
    if (device.state === 'online') {
      aggregatedState = this.currentState === 'away' ? 'away' : 'online';
    }
  });

  // 3. WRITE aggregated result using update() (preserves device data)
  await update(this.userPresenceRef, {
    state: aggregatedState,
    lastSeen: mostRecentActivity || rtdbServerTimestamp(),
  });
}
```

**Impact**: Multi-device tracking now works correctly. Users with multiple devices properly show as online when any device is active.

#### ✅ RESOLVED: AC4 UI Integration

**Previous Issue** (Third Review): PresenceIndicator component existed but was not integrated into conversation list or chat view.

**Fix Verified**:
1. **Conversation List** (ConversationListItem.tsx:103-107):
   ```tsx
   {type === 'direct' && otherParticipantId && (
     <View style={styles.presenceIndicator}>
       <PresenceIndicator userId={otherParticipantId} size="small" hideWhenOffline={false} />
     </View>
   )}
   ```

2. **Chat View Header** ([id].tsx:307-308):
   ```tsx
   {conversation.type === 'direct' && (
     <PresenceIndicator userId={otherUser.id} size="small" showLastSeen={true} />
   )}
   ```

**Impact**: Users can now see real-time online/offline status in both conversation list and chat view, with "last seen" timestamps for offline users.

#### ✅ RESOLVED: useConnectionState Reactivity Bug

**Previous Issue** (Third Review): `queuedCount` used ref value instead of state, preventing re-renders and causing 2 test failures.

**Fix Verified** (useConnectionState.ts:55):
```typescript
// ✅ NOW CORRECT - State-based queuedCount triggers re-renders
const [queuedCount, setQueuedCount] = useState(0);

// Updated in all queue operations:
queueRef.current.push({ id, operation, timestamp: Date.now() });
setQueuedCount(queueRef.current.length); // ✓ Triggers re-render
```

**Impact**: Queue count now properly updates in UI components. All 12 useConnectionState tests now pass.
