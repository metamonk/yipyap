# Story 4.3: Group Participant Management (Add/Remove/Admin)

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** group creator,
**I want** to add or remove participants and update group name/photo,
**so that** I can manage group membership and settings.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Group settings screen accessible from three-dot menu in group chat header
2. "Add Participants" option allows group creator to search and add new users (up to 50 total participant limit)
3. Added participants immediately see group in conversation list and can view full message history
4. "Remove Participant" option allows group creator to remove users from group
5. Removed participants lose access to group (conversation disappears from their list, cannot send messages)
6. "Edit Group Name" allows updating group name (visible to all participants immediately via real-time sync)
7. "Edit Group Photo" allows uploading new group photo
8. Group creator designated in conversation document (creatorId field) for permission checks
9. Only group creator can add/remove participants and edit group settings (enforced in Firestore Security Rules)
10. Firestore Security Rules updated to enforce group creator permissions for participant management

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights (Verified)

From Story 4.1 completion [Source: Story 4.1 Dev Agent Record - Implemented 2025-10-23]:

- ✅ Group creation supports up to 50 participants via unified conversation creation
- ✅ `GroupPhotoUpload` component created at `components/conversation/GroupPhotoUpload.tsx` for photo selection with compression
- ✅ `uploadGroupPhoto()` function added to `services/conversationService.ts` (lines 640-669)
- ✅ `GroupNameInput` component at `components/conversation/GroupNameInput.tsx` requires group name (not optional)
- ✅ GROUP_SIZE_LIMIT constant = 50 in `constants/groupLimits.ts` (line 37)
- ✅ Firestore rules validate 3-50 participants for group creation (lines 137-138)
- ✅ Group settings link added to chat header menu in `app/(tabs)/conversations/[id].tsx`
- ✅ `app/(tabs)/conversations/group-settings.tsx` file already created

### Data Models

**Conversation Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#conversation]

```typescript
interface Conversation {
  id: string;
  type: 'direct' | 'group';
  participantIds: string[];
  groupName?: string;
  groupPhotoURL?: string;
  creatorId?: string; // Group creator UID for permission checks
  lastMessage: {
    text: string;
    senderId: string;
    timestamp: firebase.firestore.Timestamp;
  };
  lastMessageTimestamp: firebase.firestore.Timestamp;
  unreadCount: Record<string, number>;
  archivedBy: Record<string, boolean>;
  deletedBy: Record<string, boolean>; // Per-user deletion flag
  mutedBy: Record<string, boolean>;
  createdAt: firebase.firestore.Timestamp;
  updatedAt: firebase.firestore.Timestamp;
}
```

### File Locations (Verified)

Based on actual project structure:

- **Existing screen to update:** `app/(tabs)/conversations/group-settings.tsx` (created in Story 4.1)
- **New components:** `components/conversation/AddParticipantsModal.tsx`, `components/conversation/ParticipantListItem.tsx`
- **Existing components to reuse:**
  - `components/conversation/GroupNameInput.tsx` (verified exists)
  - `components/conversation/GroupPhotoUpload.tsx` (verified exists)
  - `components/conversation/RecipientTokenField.tsx` (to be verified)
- **Service updates:** `services/conversationService.ts`
- **Constants:** `constants/groupLimits.ts` (GROUP_SIZE_LIMIT = 50, verified)
- **Security rules:** `firebase/firestore.rules`

### API Specifications

Firestore operations needed [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#service-example]:

- `updateDoc()` with `arrayUnion()` for adding participants
- `updateDoc()` with `arrayRemove()` for removing participants
- `updateDoc()` for group name/photo changes
- `serverTimestamp()` for all update operations
- Real-time listeners will automatically propagate changes

### Technical Constraints

- Max 50 participants per group [Source: Epic 4 requirements]
- Group name max 50 characters [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- Only group creator can manage participants [Source: Epic 4.3 AC]
- Removed participants use soft delete via `deletedBy` map [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- Must maintain TypeScript type safety throughout [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All async operations need try-catch with user-friendly errors [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Security Rules Pattern (Complete)

Enhanced pattern for creator-only operations [Source: firebase/firestore.rules current implementation + new requirements]:

```javascript
// Conversations - users can access if they're participants
match /conversations/{conversationId} {
  // Helper function to check if user is a participant
  function isParticipant() {
    return request.auth != null &&
           request.auth.uid in resource.data.participantIds;
  }

  // Helper function to check if user is the group creator
  function isGroupCreator() {
    return request.auth != null &&
           resource.data.type == 'group' &&
           resource.data.creatorId == request.auth.uid;
  }

  // Helper function to check if only allowed fields are being updated
  function isGroupManagementUpdate() {
    let affectedKeys = request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys();
    // These fields can only be updated by the group creator
    let creatorOnlyFields = ['participantIds', 'groupName', 'groupPhotoURL'];
    // Check if any creator-only fields are being modified
    return affectedKeys.hasAny(creatorOnlyFields);
  }

  // Read: existing rule
  allow read: if isParticipant();

  // Update: Enhanced to check creator permissions for specific fields
  allow update: if isParticipant() && (
    // Regular participants can update per-user fields only
    (!isGroupManagementUpdate() &&
     request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
       .hasOnly(['archivedBy', 'deletedBy', 'mutedBy', 'unreadCount', 'lastMessage', 'lastMessageTimestamp', 'updatedAt'])) ||
    // Group creator can update group management fields
    (isGroupCreator() && isGroupManagementUpdate() &&
     // Validate participant array changes
     (!request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasAny(['participantIds']) ||
      (request.resource.data.participantIds.size() >= 3 &&
       request.resource.data.participantIds.size() <= 50 &&
       request.auth.uid in request.resource.data.participantIds)) &&
     // Validate group name if changed
     (!request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasAny(['groupName']) ||
      (request.resource.data.groupName is string &&
       request.resource.data.groupName.size() > 0 &&
       request.resource.data.groupName.size() <= 50)))
  );
}
```

This pattern ensures:

1. Only group creator can modify `participantIds`, `groupName`, `groupPhotoURL`
2. Creator cannot remove themselves from the group
3. Participant count stays within 3-50 limit
4. Regular participants can only update their per-user fields

### Testing

**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:

- Unit tests go in `tests/unit/components/` and `tests/unit/services/`
- Use Jest + React Native Testing Library for component tests

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality with comprehensive JSDoc documentation, proper TypeScript typing, and adherence to architectural patterns. All components follow React best practices with appropriate hooks usage, memoization, and error handling. The service layer properly abstracts Firebase operations, and security rules correctly enforce creator-only permissions for participant management.

**Strengths:**

- **Documentation Excellence:** All components, interfaces, and functions include comprehensive JSDoc comments following TypeScript documentation standards (coding-standards.md lines 16-189)
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces and no `any` types
- **Architecture Compliance:** Clean separation of concerns with service layer abstraction (no direct Firebase access from components)
- **User Experience:** Proper loading states, confirmation dialogs, and disabled states throughout
- **Security Implementation:** Firestore security rules correctly implement creator-only permissions (firestore.rules lines 120-175)
- **Code Reuse:** Effective reuse of existing components (Avatar, RecipientChip, GroupPhotoUpload, GroupNameInput)
- **Error Handling:** All async operations wrapped in try-catch with user-friendly Alert messages

**Areas for Improvement:**

- **Test Coverage:** Unit tests are largely placeholder implementations with minimal assertions
- **Integration Testing:** No integration tests specifically validate Story 4.3 participant management features
- **Performance Validation:** No testing with 50 participants to verify scalability
- **Edge Case Coverage:** Missing tests for concurrent operations, boundary conditions, and error scenarios

### Security Review

✓ **PASS with CONCERNS**

**Strengths:**

- Firestore security rules properly implement creator-only permissions for participant management
- Rules validate participant array size (3-50 members) on updates
- Rules prevent creator from removing themselves from group
- Client-side permission checks provide good UX feedback
- Service layer validates permissions before Firestore operations

**Concerns:**

- Security rules tests cannot run due to Java installation issue
- No automated validation that rules correctly enforce all permission scenarios
- Integration tests should verify permission-denied errors are properly handled

**Recommendation:** Install Java to enable Firestore emulator and add comprehensive security rules tests before production deployment.

### Performance Considerations

⚠ **CONCERNS**

**Current Implementation:**

- Uses Firestore `arrayUnion()` and `arrayRemove()` for atomic operations (efficient)
- Real-time listeners automatically propagate changes to all participants
- Search functionality in `AddParticipantsModal` uses client-side filtering (potential concern with large user base)
- Profile fetching uses `getUserProfiles()` batch operation (efficient)

**Concerns:**

- No performance testing with 50 participants (similar to Story 4.2)
- `getAllUsers()` call in `AddParticipantsModal` may be slow with large user base
- No pagination for user search results
- No performance benchmarks for real-time sync with maximum participants

**Recommendations:**

- Add integration test validating real-time sync latency with 50 participants
- Consider implementing server-side user search if user base grows large
- Add pagination to user search results in `AddParticipantsModal`
- Monitor real-time sync performance in production

### Reliability Considerations

✓ **PASS**

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks throughout
- User-friendly error messages via Alert dialogs
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous operations
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental destructive actions
- Atomic Firestore operations prevent partial state updates
- Service layer validates input before Firestore calls

**Minor Observations:**

- Retry logic not implemented for failed operations (acceptable for MVP)
- No optimistic updates for add/remove operations (acceptable given confirmation dialogs)

### Maintainability Considerations

✓ **EXCELLENT**

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation on all components and functions
- Clear component structure with single responsibility
- Reusable components properly abstracted
- Service layer provides clean API for conversation operations
- TypeScript provides excellent type safety and IntelliSense
- Consistent code style throughout

### Files Modified During Review

**No files were modified during this review.** The implementation quality is excellent and does not require immediate refactoring.

### Gate Status

**Gate:** CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/epic-4.story-4.3-group-participant-management.yml

**Quality Score:** 75/100

**Risk Profile:** Medium - Solid implementation but insufficient test validation

**Summary:** Core implementation is production-quality with excellent code quality, architecture, and documentation. However, test coverage is inadequate with mostly placeholder unit tests, no integration tests for new features, and blocked security rules testing. Similar pattern to Story 4.2 - great code, insufficient validation.

### Recommended Status

**Changes Required** - Must address test coverage gaps before production deployment.

**Priority Actions:**

1. Implement comprehensive unit tests (replace all placeholder tests)
2. Add integration tests for `addParticipants()` and `removeParticipant()`
3. Fix Java installation to enable Firestore rules testing
4. Add E2E tests for participant management workflows

**Once Testing Complete:** Story will be production-ready. Implementation quality is excellent.

**Decision Authority:** Story owner decides whether to address testing concerns now or accept technical debt and address in future sprint.

### Comparison to Previous Stories

- **Story 4.1 (Group Creation):** PASS (Quality: 100) - Had comprehensive test coverage after initial CONCERNS resolved
- **Story 4.2 (Group Messaging):** CONCERNS (Quality: 80) - Excellent implementation but incomplete performance testing
- **Story 4.3 (Participant Management):** CONCERNS (Quality: 75) - Excellent implementation but inadequate test coverage

**Pattern Observation:** Epic 4 consistently delivers high-quality implementations with excellent code quality and architecture, but test coverage has declined across Stories 4.2 and 4.3. Recommend prioritizing test completion for remaining Epic 4 stories.

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Response to Initial QA Concerns

**Excellent work addressing the P0 concerns from initial review!** The developer has systematically resolved the critical testing gaps identified in the first review.

### Improvements Verified

**✅ Unit Tests - EXCELLENT IMPROVEMENT**

- **Previous State:** Placeholder tests with minimal assertions (`expect(true).toBe(true)`)
- **Current State:** 17 comprehensive unit tests - **ALL PASSING** (verified via `npm test`)
- **Coverage Details:**
  - `addParticipants()`: 9 comprehensive tests
    - Empty array validation
    - Conversation existence check
    - Group type validation
    - Creator permission enforcement
    - 50-member limit validation (including boundary test at exactly 50)
    - Successful operation with arrayUnion verification
    - Firestore permission-denied error handling
    - Generic Firestore error handling
  - `removeParticipant()`: 8 comprehensive tests
    - Conversation existence check
    - Group type validation
    - Creator permission enforcement
    - Prevention of creator self-removal
    - Participant existence validation
    - Successful removal with arrayRemove and soft delete verification
    - Firestore permission-denied error handling
    - Generic Firestore error handling

**✅ Integration Tests - EXCELLENT IMPROVEMENT**

- **Previous State:** No integration tests for Story 4.3 participant management
- **Current State:** 5 comprehensive integration tests added to `tests/integration/group-messaging.test.ts`
- **Coverage Details:**
  1. Real-time sync validation after adding participants (lines 446-500)
  2. Real-time sync validation after removing participants (lines 502-558)
  3. Concurrent add/remove operations handling (lines 560-614)
  4. Boundary limit enforcement at exactly 50 members (lines 616-664)
  5. Real-time performance validation under 500ms (lines 666-719)

**⚠️ Java Installation - PARTIAL (Minor Configuration Issue)**

- **Previous State:** Java not installed
- **Current State:** Java 17.0.17 installed via Homebrew at `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk@17/17.0.17/`
- **Issue:** Java is installed but not linked to system PATH
- **Solution:** Simple PATH configuration needed:
  ```bash
  export JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk@17/17.0.17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home"
  export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
  ```
- **Impact:** Minor - Firebase Emulator can work with proper environment variables, security rules tests can be run with explicit JAVA_HOME

**⚠️ Performance Testing - NOT ADDRESSED (Acceptable)**

- **Previous State:** No performance testing with 50 participants
- **Current State:** Still no explicit performance testing
- **Rationale:** This was marked as P1 (future) priority in original review
