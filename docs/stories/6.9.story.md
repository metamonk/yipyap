# Story 6.9: Migrate Voice Training to OpenAI SDK

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** development team,
**I want** to migrate voice training and matching from Vercel AI SDK to direct OpenAI SDK calls,
**so that** we use a consistent AI SDK across all Cloud Functions and reduce dependency complexity.

## Context

Story 6.8 successfully migrated the daily agent workflow from Vercel Edge Functions to Firebase Cloud Functions using the OpenAI SDK directly. However, voice training and matching features still use the Vercel AI SDK (`@ai-sdk/openai` + `ai`), creating inconsistency in our codebase.

**Current Architecture:**
```
Voice Training/Matching → Vercel AI SDK → OpenAI API
                           ↓
                    Extra abstraction layer
```

**Target Architecture:**
```
Voice Training/Matching → OpenAI SDK (direct)
                           ↓
                  Consistent with daily agent workflow
```

**Affected Files:**
- `functions/src/ai/voiceTraining.ts` - Uses `generateText()` from Vercel AI SDK
- `functions/src/ai/voiceRetraining.ts` - Uses `generateText()` from Vercel AI SDK
- `functions/src/ai/voiceMatching.ts` - Uses `generateText()` from Vercel AI SDK

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Migration Completeness:**
   - AC1: `voiceTraining.ts` uses OpenAI SDK instead of Vercel AI SDK
   - AC2: `voiceRetraining.ts` uses OpenAI SDK instead of Vercel AI SDK
   - AC3: `voiceMatching.ts` uses OpenAI SDK instead of Vercel AI SDK
   - AC4: All prompts and response formats remain identical (output parity)

2. **Functionality:**
   - AC5: Voice profile generation works identically to current implementation
   - AC6: Voice retraining (weekly/biweekly/monthly) produces same results
   - AC7: Voice matching returns identical similarity scores

3. **Testing & Validation:**
   - AC8: Unit tests prove voice training output parity (old vs new)
   - AC9: Unit tests prove voice retraining output parity
   - AC10: Unit tests prove voice matching output parity
   - AC11: All existing tests continue to pass

4. **Deployment & Verification:**
   - AC12: Production deployment successful with no errors
   - AC13: Voice training functions work correctly in production
   - AC14: No increase in error rates or failures

5. **Code Quality:**
   - AC15: JSDoc documentation added to all migrated functions
   - AC16: No dead code or unused imports remain
   - AC17: TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors
   - AC18: Linting passes with no new warnings

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

- **Story 6.8**: Successfully migrated daily agent workflow from Vercel Edge Functions to OpenAI SDK
  - Eliminated HTTP overhead (5-13s improvement)
  - Created comprehensive unit tests (15 tests passing)
  - Established pattern for migrating Vercel AI SDK to OpenAI SDK

### Key Considerations

1. **Voice Training Frequency**: Voice training runs weekly/biweekly/monthly (not daily), so performance improvement is less critical than consistency
2. **Model Selection**: Voice training uses GPT-4 Turbo for quality (same as before)
3. **Prompt Compatibility**: All prompts must remain identical to ensure output parity
4. **Error Handling**: Voice training has retry logic that must be preserved
5. **Testing Strategy**: Focus on output parity tests (same inputs → same outputs)

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Mock OpenAI SDK responses, test all code paths
- **Parity Tests**: Compare outputs from old (Vercel AI SDK) vs new (OpenAI SDK) implementations
- **Integration Tests**: Test in production with real user data (smoke test)
- **Regression Tests**: Verify existing voice training tests still pass
